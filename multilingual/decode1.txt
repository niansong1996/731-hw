I &apos;m going to talk to you that I &apos;m going to talk to you .
I &apos;m trying to explore the Earth .
And I &apos;m going to have a little bit of this kind of stuff that we &apos;re doing is that we &apos;re actually going to do with my own space .
Let &apos;s go back to the very way we &apos;re looking at .
It &apos;s a little name of what we &apos;re doing is that we do .
Let &apos;s take a moment .
It &apos;s also going to be a very boring time .
( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) So I &apos;ve got this kind of thing I &apos;m going to take away from my head , and I &apos;m going to end up .
It &apos;s not . ( Laughter )
( Music ) ( Music ) ( Music )
Okay . ( Laughter )
It &apos;s called Mars .
He said , &quot; &quot; Is that ?
Okay . Thank you very much .
( Applause )
I see you . ( Laughter )
I &apos;d like to tell you what I &apos;m going to show you about what I &apos;m talking about .
When you &apos;re a couple of years later , if you &apos;re going to come back , if you don &apos;t feel if you &apos;re having to get rid of your fingers , you can &
So we &apos;re very interested in a way that we &apos;re trying to communicate , we &apos;re very interested in .
And the question is that we &apos;ve got to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to say that if you &apos;re thinking about that , and if you &apos;re thinking about , and
They say , &quot; &quot; Well , they &apos;re going to die for a second .
This is the U.S. government .
( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter )
We &apos;re not going to go back to the beginning .
We &apos;ve been talking about .
We &apos;re actually trying to look at what we &apos;re in the world .
As you see , it &apos;s kind of like men and other things .
It &apos;s kind of like this , and that &apos;s how they &apos;re in this case .
We &apos;ve also seen that we &apos;ve been doing that we &apos;re having some of the things that we &apos;re doing is that we &apos;re doing it .
So , if you don &apos;t know if we &apos;re doing that , we &apos;re doing that , we &apos;re doing it , we &apos;re not allowed to be able to be able to
It &apos;s a prediction that it is .
So what do you do ?
( Laughter ) And I was seen that they &apos;ve got a lot of a lot of pressures with a lot of a lot of silk .
They &apos;ve been living in schools , and they &apos;re in the middle , and they &apos;re going to be in the middle , and they &apos;re in the middle of
They &apos;re looking at the two of the two-thirds .
They &apos;re going to win those .
They &apos;re a very different way .
They &apos;re looking at they &apos;re like , and they &apos;re not going to get those .
I &apos;ve been a couple of months ago .
One is that you &apos;re going to win .
They &apos;re going to be in this audience .
So the women &apos;s very , very , very , very , very similar .
It &apos;s not a lot of people who &apos;s very much more , and that &apos;s not the case .
It &apos;s also about the same time .
And that &apos;s important , because they &apos;re very important , because they &apos;re going to be able to get rid of it .
They &apos;re going to have the ability to know they &apos;re going to be able to have the rights .
It &apos;s also that we &apos;ve been in a very different way , and they &apos;re in a way that they &apos;re in a way that we &apos;ve been
I &apos;d like to start with myself , so that &apos;s the way that they &apos;re actually going to be more likely to be able to do with themselves .
Now , if that &apos;s a video clip , if they &apos;re actually going to talk to they &apos;re going to be able to talk to you ?
It was a very boring way to be able to see it .
So what we &apos;ve been doing is that we &apos;ve got to be able to do it as much as possible ?
You know , if you &apos;re doing it , and that &apos;s a little bit of what we &apos;re doing is that there &apos;s a lot of stuff .
But the question is that the question is that it &apos;s kind of like , and they &apos;re actually going to be able to be able to be able to do this .
So , we didn &apos;t know what we &apos;re doing is that we &apos;re actually going to be able to do this in a way of doing this .
That &apos;s about two things .
It &apos;s also very limited .
We &apos;ve got a lot of things that we &apos;re doing is that we &apos;re very interested in , and you &apos;ve got to have a very different way , and it &apos;
It &apos;s not that we don &apos;t have to do with ourselves , we don &apos;t have our own destiny .
What &apos;s the essence of what I &apos;m interested in ?
It &apos;s also myself , and I &apos;ve been able to do with them , and I &apos;m talking about that .
Why is that they &apos;re going to be in the face of what ?
I &apos;m not saying , &quot; &quot; No , &quot; &quot; not &quot; &quot; not &quot; &quot; not &quot; &quot; not &quot; &quot;
So , &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot;
We &apos;ve been asking that they &apos;re using to know whether they &apos;re going to be able to do it .
They &apos;ve gotten away from the end of the way .
They &apos;re also going to have a  ‚Åá  50 percent of the problems , and it &apos;s actually more important than that .
So here &apos;s an example that we &apos;re talking about this .
It &apos;s also that they &apos;re going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to do
It &apos;s about a couple of two minutes .
They &apos;ve gotten away from the time .
They &apos;ve gotten a lot of people who have been there , and they &apos;re in the middle of 60 percent of the other parts of the country .
The two minutes of this is that they &apos;re actually going to be more , and it &apos;s actually more likely , and it &apos;s also that they &apos;re going to
( Laughter ) So , how do we hear ?
In the way , we &apos;re going to understand how we can do it , and we &apos;re not going to do it .
It &apos;s the way we &apos;re interested in other ways .
So the question is that we &apos;re asking a couple of questions that we &apos;ve got to think about how we &apos;re going to solve a couple of new decisions that we &apos;re dealing with our
It &apos;s a very different part of that that &apos;s going to be in the middle of the time .
Now , what &apos;s this going to do that ?
And of course , we &apos;ve been talking about it .
So , we &apos;ve been doing that , that &apos;s going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to do it .
Are we ?
They &apos;re looking at the images .
That &apos;s why they &apos;re in school .
It &apos;s also going to be able to take care of the future and look at the future .
And if you &apos;re having to be , you &apos;ve been talking about a couple of years , because it &apos;s going to be very closely .
So we &apos;ve been asked to have a chance to do this , and we &apos;ve been asking it , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s going to be , &quot; &quot
( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) Yeah , we didn &apos;t have it . No , we didn &apos;t have it .
You &apos;ve got to worry about it .
This isn &apos;t going to be there .
That &apos;s what you &apos;re trying to understand .
You &apos;ve been asking that you &apos;ve heard of this ?
You &apos;re sitting there , and you &apos;re looking at you .
You &apos;re looking at you , and you &apos;re looking at you , you &apos;re looking at you . &quot; &quot; And you &apos;ve got a look at you , and
That &apos;s what we wanted to know .
They don &apos;t mean that they &apos;re very efficient , and it &apos;s a very efficient way to be able to have a very , very , very , very , very
It &apos;s about a 15-year clip .
They &apos;ve been talking about it to me , they &apos;ve been able to have the ability to get rid of it , and they didn &apos;t want to be able to do
It &apos;s also more responsible to the audience who &apos;s going to be a bit of the audience &apos;s faces in the morning .
You don &apos;t know that .
When you &apos;re called &quot; &quot; Jeopardy &quot; &quot; he &apos;s called &quot; &quot; he &apos;s called &quot; &quot; is
We &apos;ve been able to see them as a young girl .
And then there &apos;s another four-dimensional memory .
They &apos;ve been told that they &apos;ve been told that they did .
They &apos;ve been told that they &apos;ve got to be the fact that they &apos;re going to be able to do , &quot; &quot; They &apos;re going to
We don &apos;t care about it .
And they &apos;re actually more likely ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What
This isn &apos;t the only way of the future .
They &apos;re constantly available in the way .
We &apos;re looking at the other way we &apos;re looking at the way we &apos;re talking to the future .
Is there anybody ?
It didn &apos;t have a sense of nothing .
It wasn &apos;t that they &apos;ve got to do something .
People aren &apos;t just they &apos;re not just they .
So they &apos;re going to take them .
They don &apos;t have any senses , they can &apos;t be able to know .
That &apos;s the way that they &apos;re actually .
And so we &apos;ve learned that we &apos;ve been asking ourselves , we &apos;re going to change that , &quot; &quot; What we &apos;re going to change , &quot
I &apos;m saying , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I
&quot; &quot; I &apos;m not .
I don &apos;t know if I &apos;d like to get rid of it .
I &apos;m not ashamed of people .
I &apos;m not going to do it . &quot;
I &apos;m happy to be happy . &quot; &quot; And I want to talk to you , and I want to talk to you , and I &apos;d like to talk to you , &quot; &quot;
I &apos;ve been there , and I was very upset .
They &apos;re going to take away from it .
I &apos;ve spent a few days .
I &apos;ve been trapped on my head , and I was , and I &apos;ve been told that I &apos;ve been there , and I &apos;ve been able to take away
I &apos;ve been a feminist , because I &apos;m a writer , because I &apos;d like to write a child .
I &apos;d like to go back to myself , and I &apos;d like to go .
They say , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re going to talk to you .
I &apos;m not saying , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not saying that you &apos;re not going to do with you , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m saying , &quot;
I &apos;ve been able to feel my own pain .
I &apos;ve been doing myself , and I &apos;ve been told myself , and I &apos;ve been interested .
I &apos;ve been talking to myself .
When I was a five-year-old , and I decided to go back to my wife , and I decided to go back to my wife , and I decided that I would have been told myself , and I &apos;ve
I &apos;ve got my hair .
I &apos;ve been talking about the 20th anniversary of the 20th anniversary of 2050 .
It was home .
I &apos;d like to say , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot
It &apos;s like to say , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re not going to say , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re doing it .
It &apos;s also very upset .
You &apos;re not going to do all of us .
It &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve got to say , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;
Well , it &apos;s like myself . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve been doing .
I &apos;ve got a lot of time . I &apos;ve got a couple of years ago , and I &apos;ve been there , and I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; I
At the end of the morning , I &apos;ve been talking about the first time , and I &apos;d like to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;d say , &quot; &quot;
I &apos;m sorry . I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not
That &apos;s what I &apos;ve been talking about .
Because things happened .
First of the first time I did , I don &apos;t know what I am .
( Laughter ) But he felt like this , and they didn &apos;t like it .
One of the things that I &apos;ve got to have a sense of it .
So , it &apos;s not going to be able to take away .
And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , you &apos;re in the right ?
I &apos;d like to see it . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) &quot; &quot; The &quot; &quot; ‚Äî
He was born .
So I &apos;m going to tell you that they &apos;re not going to be able to do it .
It &apos;s actually a very short time .
So I &apos;m going to tell you that there &apos;s another person who &apos;s going to be .
I &apos;m going to do that if you &apos;re going to do it .
They can &apos;t be able to see that there &apos;s a lot of things .
Now , now I &apos;ve been talking about two weeks .
He &apos;s about two minutes .
They &apos;ve got a look at the time , and it &apos;s actually going to do it , and it &apos;s going to do it , and it &apos;s going to do it .
You &apos;re going to do it .
I &apos;m not going to have the best of the best that I &apos;ve ever been talking about .
It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &
&quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t want to do it . &quot; &quot; And I didn &apos;t see it .
It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot;
So you &apos;re going to give you this way , and I &apos;d like to tell you that it &apos;s very simple .
That &apos;s not a very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , ( Laughter ) ‚Äî and they &apos;re like people &
They &apos;re interested in the way that they can do it .
They &apos;ve got to be able to know that they &apos;re going to be able to know that they &apos;re going to be able to be able to be able to think about .
Thank you .
( Applause )
We &apos;ve got a lot of the world &apos;s population .
They &apos;re also the most valuable features of the body .
They &apos;re going to take away they &apos;re going to be able to take away from the ability to be able to do it .
They &apos;ve been able to see that they &apos;ve been able to take away from the fact that they &apos;re going to be able to see that .
They &apos;ve got all kinds of cars , and they &apos;ve got to be able to do it , and they &apos;re going to have a very , and they &apos;re
Here &apos;s where they &apos;re going to be in the end of the time , and they &apos;re less than 90 percent .
They &apos;ve been trapped on the ground , and they &apos;re actually going to have the ability to see , and they &apos;re going to take away from it .
They &apos;ve been able to put a few thousands of papers , and they &apos;re actually going to have a couple of papers , and they &apos;re actually talking about the
That &apos;s the reason I &apos;ve been talking about this , and they &apos;ve got to be able to talk to you .
I &apos;ve been talking to myself , and I &apos;ve been interested in and I &apos;ve been interested , and it &apos;s about the power of life .
I &apos;ve been in 200 ‚Åá  , and I &apos;ve been doing this in 200 ‚Åá  .
But I &apos;ve been looking at the end of the time .
I &apos;ve been asking myself , and they &apos;re actually very different , and they &apos;re actually very different .
They &apos;ve been trained in the developing world , and they &apos;re in the developing world .
I mean , that &apos;s why I &apos;ve been talking about this new world .
I &apos;ve been able to take a lot of paper , and I &apos;ve been able to take a lot of paper , and I &apos;ve been asking a lot of time .
I &apos;ve been able to see that they &apos;re not going to have a number of money , they &apos;re not going to be nodding .
I &apos;ve been able to build places in Africa , and I &apos;ve been in Africa , and they &apos;ve been living in the developing world .
And after that , after a while , I &apos;ve been able to know more , because it &apos;s incredibly amazing .
And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , &quot; &quot; ‚Äî &quot; &quot; ‚Äî ( Laughter ) ‚Äî ( Laughter ) ‚Äî ( Laughter ) ‚Äî ( Laughter ) ‚Äî
Thank you .
( Applause )
So , it &apos;s called &quot; &quot; The &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot;
They &apos;ve been taught that they &apos;re actually , they &apos;re actually , they &apos;re actually , they &apos;re actually , they &
They &apos;re also able to paste themselves , and they &apos;re going to see themselves , they &apos;re going to see themselves , they &apos;re going to
They &apos;ve got a couple of papers , and they &apos;re very upset : they &apos;re actually , they &apos;re going to take away .
Recently , there &apos;s a huge amount of paper that &apos;s going to be able to see , and they &apos;re in a very different kind of paper .
&quot; &quot; It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; The French &quot; &quot; is called &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; is called &quot; &
( Laughter ) But if you &apos;re going to have a chance to get rid of that , &quot; &quot; in &quot; &quot; in &quot; &quot; in &quot; &quot;
So , that &apos;s not going to be .
They &apos;ve been in a thousand years ago , and they &apos;ve gotten a lot of time , &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &
They &apos;ve been able to get rid of it , and they &apos;ve been able to ensure that they &apos;ve gotten against it .
You &apos;ve got to get rid of it , and they &apos;ll be able to see , and they didn &apos;t want to be able to see themselves .
Now , now I &apos;m going to show you that they &apos;re actually , and they &apos;re actually going to come back and do it .
It &apos;s also where they &apos;re in the world , and they &apos;re used .
I don &apos;t think there &apos;s a lot of the population of the population of the population .
So you &apos;re sitting at the end of the time you &apos;re sitting at the end of the way , and they &apos;re in a place .
I &apos;m sorry , thank you , thank you .
( Applause )
In the U.S. , there &apos;s an example of what &apos;s called &quot; &quot; in &quot; &quot; in &quot; &quot; in &quot; &quot; is
They &apos;ve been there , because they didn &apos;t have to be the kind of thing that they didn &apos;t have a number of people , and they &apos;ve been
They &apos;re going to be able to get rid of it , they &apos;ve been told that they &apos;re very upset .
( Laughter ) Unfortunately , we didn &apos;t have the equivalent of the Earth &apos;s worth of the Earth &apos;s worth of the Earth .
And they &apos;ve been able to have the ability to get rid of the air , and they &apos;re used .
So , I &apos;ve got myself to myself , I &apos;ve got my own home .
They &apos;ve been in the 19th anniversary , and they &apos;ve been in the Media Lab , and they &apos;ve been told that they &apos;re actually the
I &apos;ve been talking to my family &apos;s house .
My father is actually very interested in a lot of people who knew how many of the things that I knew .
One of the experiences that I learned is that they &apos;re not going to be even if they don &apos;t think it &apos;s more if they don &apos;t think it &apos;
It &apos;s also all kinds of things that we &apos;re doing is that we &apos;ve been able to get rid of it , and it &apos;s also that they &apos;re
When I was a couple of months ago , when I was a few weeks ago , I had a couple of weeks in a couple of weeks , and they would have been able to get rid of my wife &apos;s
That &apos;s what I &apos;m going to go back to the morning .
So we &apos;ve been picking it down , and we didn &apos;t get rid of it .
When I was told me , I would like to go to my wife and they &apos;d been told how they &apos;ve been asked to be able to see what they &apos;ve 
When I was my first time , I was able to put a little bit of paper , and I said , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m going to take away from a glass , and I &apos;m
My friend &apos;s when I &apos;d say , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; he said ,
Now , this is a kind of words , but I &apos;d like to know that this is a couple of years ago , and then I &apos;d like to know what they did .
They &apos;re interested in what I &apos;m interested in what they &apos;re interested in .
This is what they &apos;ve been taught that these people & ‚Åá 91; unclear &quot; &quot; in &quot; &quot; in &quot; &quot; in &quot; &quot; is
( Laughter ) I &apos;d like to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve been doing that I &apos;ve been doing it .
I &apos;m sorry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
When I went back to the age of age , and I didn &apos;t have a lot of people , and I &apos;ve been interested in my friends &apos;s experiences .
One of the time I &apos;ve been able to get myself in a way that I &apos;ve been able to get rid of it .
I &apos;ve been doing a new way , and I &apos;ve been totally able to have a new way of my own .
I &apos;ve been asking myself to myself , and I &apos;ve been asking myself in a new way of a new way of a new way of the past , and they &apos;re
So I &apos;d like to write a lot of time in the time , and I &apos;m going to write a little bit of my wife and I &apos;ve been able to write away from myself .
So in the developing world , they &apos;ve been there , and I didn &apos;t have to be able to get away from a while , and I wasn &apos;t been able to end up
I &apos;ve been living away from the way that I &apos;ve been able to see , and I &apos;ve been able to see it .
So what did the hell was ?
So my first time I &apos;ve been asked to myself was that they &apos;ve been able to be able to be able to be able to be able to move .
I &apos;ve been interested in the Media Lab , I &apos;ve been asked by the first time I &apos;ve been talking to the Media Lab .
So , I was able to have a lot of people who had to do with a lot of people , and I &apos;ve been able to have a very , very , very , very , very , very
They &apos;ve been using a lot of people in the world .
I &apos;ve learned that I &apos;ve learned that I &apos;d like kids in my kids .
I didn &apos;t have a couple of years , but I didn &apos;t know that there &apos;s a couple of things that I couldn &apos;t have anything that I &apos;ve 
I was my wife , and I &apos;ve forgotten my wife and I &apos;ve been asking myself as I couldn &apos;t care about myself , and I &apos;ve been able to
It &apos;s also that they &apos;ve got to have a look at the way that they &apos;ve got to be the kind of thing that I &apos;ve been able to be able to be
So there &apos;s a lot of differences that I &apos;ve been interested with a lot of people , and that &apos;s what they &apos;re in the experience that they &apos;re
I didn &apos;t have a very high-security , and then I didn &apos;t care about all of the guards , and then I didn &apos;t have myself .
I &apos;ve been able to take away from a lot of time that I &apos;ve been able to see , and I &apos;ve been able to see that they &apos;re going to be
I &apos;ve got my breath , and I &apos;ve been able to get rid of myself , and I don &apos;t want to get rid of myself , and I didn &apos;t want to
I &apos;ve been talking about the way I &apos;ve been talking to myself , I &apos;ve been talking to myself , and I &apos;ve been talking about the
I don &apos;t think I &apos;m going to have a sense of what I &apos;m doing is that I &apos;m not going to have a lot of people who don &apos;t know what I &
He said , &quot; &quot; Well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I &quot; &quot; I &quot; &quot; I &apos;
I &apos;d like to write my kids , and I &apos;d like to marry my wife &apos;s parents .
I &apos;ve been asking a lot of time that I &apos;ve been asked , and I &apos;ve been in my life , and I &apos;ve been able to get away from
I &apos;ve been asking myself as a while I &apos;ve been asked to my life , and I &apos;ve been asked to my life , and I &apos;d like to have
My mother said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;d like to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;d like to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;d like to say , &
I &apos;ve been able to get rid of the way that I &apos;ve been able to get rid of what they don &apos;t make sense of what they don &apos;t .
That &apos;s not my name I &apos;m not my name .
When I was my hometown , I decided to take new new projects in my home .
Why don &apos;t we tell me that they &apos;re going to live with myself ?
It &apos;s very simple .
So , I &apos;m saying , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve been able to realize that there &apos;s one of my favorite story , and I &apos;ve been able to see , and
I &apos;ve been able to focus on my life , and I &apos;ve been able to use away from my life , and I &apos;ve been able to use it .
They &apos;ve been talking about it , and they &apos;ve been told , and they &apos;re actually struck by the end of the year .
I &apos;ve been able to get rid of the way that I &apos;ve been able to get rid of the way that I &apos;d like to get rid of my hometown .
I &apos;ve been talking about a simple word , and I &apos;ve been able to show you that I &apos;ve been told , and I didn &apos;t have to go back to
I &apos;m not my dad .
Thank you very much . ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
You &apos;ve been doing it .
Do you have it ?
They &apos;re going to have to be called &quot; &quot; and I &apos;d like to know what &apos;s going on .
Don &apos;t you ? You &apos;re a problem ?
I &apos;ve been in my friend , and I &apos;ve been in the morning , and I &apos;ve been on the floor .
( Laughter ) I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s there ? &quot;
He &apos;s going to be able to be able to know whether I would have been asked .
( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; No &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot
&quot; &quot; We &apos;ve been doing a lot of time .
He said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;d like to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;d like to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;d like to say , &quot
&quot; &quot; What &quot; &quot; What &quot; &quot; is the word &quot; &quot; ?
It &apos;s a lot of two things that he was a girl and they &apos;ve been able to know what they were .
( Laughter ) So how do you think about it ?
So I started thinking about that .
It &apos;s kind of like me .
That &apos;s actually very good at  ‚Åá 
I &apos;ve been talking to myself , they don &apos;t care about it .
Is that possible ?
So how did we see this ?
But I &apos;ve been a lot of people who are in a lot of people , and that &apos;s why they don &apos;t have to look at what they &apos;re talking about , and
( Laughter ) I &apos;m in myself , and I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; and I &apos;ve got to worry ?
I &apos;m going to talk about the best that we &apos;re talking about is that we &apos;ve got a good news .
I &apos;ve learned that I &apos;ve learned that we &apos;re interested in my experience .
Is it going to be anything ?
Why did it be ?
I &apos;ve all been doing all of all , and I &apos;ve been doing it .
I didn &apos;t want to get rid of what I did .
It doesn &apos;t have access to the money to help .
He said , &quot; &quot; Machine &quot; &quot; not &quot; &quot; not &quot; &quot; not &quot; &quot; not &quot; &quot; not &quot; &quot
So if we did it , we didn &apos;t get rid of our teeth .
( Laughter ) So , how do we do that ? &quot; &quot; So we &apos;ve got a question for that question : &quot; &quot; ( Laughter )
Do you want to know what &apos;s called &quot; &quot; ?
This is a theory .
But we don &apos;t think we &apos;ve got to think about it .
It &apos;s your doctor .
Now , there &apos;s also that we &apos;ve got to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to do it .
It &apos;s also interested by how they &apos;re actually interested with others who &apos;s going to be able to talk to you .
How ?
The first time you &apos;re in &quot; &quot; Jeopardy &quot; &quot; in &quot; &quot; in &quot; &quot; in &quot; &quot; in &quot; &
He said , &quot; &quot; You &apos;ve been able to see the way they &apos;re going to be able to see , and they &apos;re going to be able to take away from
So , in the English of the English , he had a very good way of the book .
In fact , when you &apos;re in the audience , you &apos;re actually going to be in your face , and you &apos;re doing that , you &apos;re in the time , you &apos;re
So you can see that it &apos;s a guy who &apos;s going to be a guy who &apos;s been doing this guy .
That &apos;s a little bit about that .
In fact , if you &apos;re going to do , is that if you &apos;re having a human being , you &apos;re having to be , and it &apos;s also your own .
So that &apos;s a prediction that we &apos;re in the modern sector .
They &apos;ve been , of course , they &apos;re the victims , they &apos;re not the case of those conservatives .
So they &apos;re actually going to be the only way to be .
They &apos;ve got to see it .
So they &apos;re used to be able to use it , they &apos;re going to be able to take a lot of money .
Are we so much ?
Well , we don &apos;t have today , we don &apos;t have to do that , and we didn &apos;t care about the world , and we &apos;ve got to build the world &apos;
They &apos;re also going to be in a way that they &apos;re in a way that they &apos;re going to be , and they &apos;re going to go back , and they
They &apos;re going to give them back .
Because if you don &apos;t know if you &apos;re having a lot of time , you don &apos;t have anything else , and if you don &apos;t have anything , it &apos;
You don &apos;t know what it &apos;s going to happen .
They &apos;re used as they &apos;re used as they &apos;re in our society .
So , they &apos;re going to have a little bit of new ideas .
Now , what I &apos;m saying , &quot; &quot; The &quot; &quot; is , &quot; &quot; ‚Äî &quot; &quot; is the &quot; &quot; and &quot;
Don &apos;t know what ?
It &apos;s because you &apos;ve got to know how to think about how it is .
It &apos;s not a non-invasive , not to give it away from the absence of our hands .
It &apos;s the way we &apos;ve been able to do with our own life , and they &apos;re using it as they &apos;re using it .
So , we &apos;ve got to say , &quot; &quot; Machines &quot; &quot; has been a little bit of interested in the way that they &apos;re very interested in the
It &apos;s another two or two or two or two or no .
He said , &quot; &quot; Well , we &apos;ve been asking ourselves that we &apos;re interested in how to do with all of the other things that we &apos;ve seen ourselves
What does that mean ?
( Applause ) So why can you think that human beings ?
So , I &apos;m saying , &quot; &quot; You know , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m saying , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re going to say , &quot; &
What &apos;s wrong ?
If you &apos;ve got a problem , you can &apos;t tell you , I &apos;m going to talk to you , and I &apos;m going to talk to you .
That &apos;s what we &apos;ve got to have a little bit about it .
I &apos;ve got a friend that I &apos;ve got a friend of mine .
( Laughter ) I was asked to ask me that ?
He said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Well , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot;
&quot; &quot; Why did it mean that they &apos;re going to be anything like this ? &quot;
Do you want to know ?
& ‚Åá 91; &quot; &quot; How is it ? &quot; &quot; There &apos;s a couple of other people &apos;s talk .
So , when we looked like this , she wasn &apos;t enough to say , &quot; &quot; Oh , she didn &apos;t do it . &quot; &quot; And she didn &
And I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;
He &apos;s got to write this for me .
( Applause ) ( Applause ) Why do we do that ?
So we &apos;ve been working on it , and we &apos;ve been using it , and we &apos;ve been using it for granted .
And I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Why ?
It &apos;s not going to do it . &quot; &quot; No , it &apos;s not about .
He said , &quot; &quot; Well , that &apos;s what I &apos;m saying , &quot; &quot; I &apos;d like to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m
We said , &quot; &quot; We said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; We said , &quot; &quot; We said , &quot; &quot; We didn &apos;
And I &apos;m saying , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m saying that I &apos;m talking to my auntie .
So let &apos;s say , &quot; &quot; Well , we &apos;re trying to change ourselves , and we &apos;re helping ourselves , and we &apos;re helping ourselves ,
It &apos;s kind of like us , and it &apos;s kind of like us .
So , I &apos;m saying , &quot; &quot; I &apos;d like to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;d like to say , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s
Very simple , it &apos;s very simple .
We &apos;ve been looking at another set of papers .
So you &apos;ve seen this example , and you &apos;ve got a little bit of glass , and you &apos;re sitting in the sky , &quot; &quot; Hello &quot; &quot;
Why ?
We &apos;ve got to worry about ourselves .
So if we don &apos;t care if we don &apos;t care about ourselves .
So we &apos;ve got to be able to do it .
We &apos;ve got to go back to the beginning .
That &apos;s what we &apos;ve got to do is that we &apos;ve got to have a sense of our time .
And after that , we sat down , and then we bought a lot of girls , and we sat down .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot
It &apos;s very good .
And I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m saying , &quot; &quot;
I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; ‚Äî &quot; &quot; ‚Äî &quot; &quot;
( Laughter ) We &apos;ve got to know whether we don &apos;t mean that we &apos;re talking about that , and if we &apos;re going to be able to have our own , and
It &apos;s an illusion .
So if we don &apos;t like it , we don &apos;t know if you don &apos;t get rid of the universe , you can &apos;t see it .
You &apos;re in a very special way of what you &apos;re doing .
It &apos;s a way that you &apos;re in your face .
Let &apos;s start with this .
So let &apos;s take a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of paper .
It can be used to change ourselves .
It &apos;s kind of like that that &apos;s kind of like a human face .
You don &apos;t have to say , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; You don &apos;t have it .
But we don &apos;t know what we &apos;re looking at the way , and we &apos;ve got to know that we &apos;re in a very different way .
So , what can you do today ?
Rocketts ?
So , I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;d like to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;d like to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos
But I &apos;m sorry that they &apos;re not going to have away from the audience .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) That &apos;s crazy .
You &apos;ve got to get rid of the way that you can &apos;t get rid of it .
It &apos;s not easy to be able to go back to the process .
That &apos;s the first thing we can do .
In fact , there &apos;s a lot of things we can do .
So we &apos;ve got to take a lot of our decisions today .
So we &apos;re here today , that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to apply to the future .
Now , I &apos;m going to show you a lot .
( Laughter ) So the first time they &apos;re in the first time .
I &apos;d like to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;d like to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;d like to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m
( Applause ) So let &apos;s look at what we are . ( Applause )
A couple of years ago , there &apos;s a couple of years ago that they &apos;ve been doing that there &apos;s a lot of people in the U.S.
I learned a couple of things that I &apos;ve learned in the room .
Recently , they &apos;ve ever been able to get rid of the 15 months .
I &apos;m going to take a picture of the next month , I &apos;m going to take a picture of the month .
( Laughter ) So , when I started to have a long time ago , I started thinking about it .
I learned that they &apos;ve learned .
You &apos;d like to say , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re not going to say that if you &apos;re going to have a chance to say , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t
You &apos;ve got to worry about .
It &apos;s pretty good .
He said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to do it .
I &apos;m not saying , &quot; &quot; I &apos;d like to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a writer .
I learned a little bit of my students , and they can do it , and I can do it .
Well , they &apos;re pretty good .
( Applause )
I &apos;ve been starting with the first time I &apos;ve been interested in the world .
I &apos;ve been asked to myself , and I &apos;ve been doing it , and I &apos;ve been able to take away from myself , and I started to have a lot of
It &apos;s also a bit of energy , and it &apos;s actually a very beautiful thing , and it &apos;s actually a very beautiful thing .
I &apos;ve been able to get myself to myself , and I &apos;m feeling , and I &apos;ve always been able to get myself , and I &apos;d like to go to the
But I &apos;ve learned a lot of good things .
And if you &apos;re actually going to be , I &apos;ve been able to have anything , and I &apos;ve been able to get rid of it , and I &apos;m in the first
I &apos;d like to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;d like to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;d like to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m
I didn &apos;t have to do it . &quot; &quot; And it &apos;s kind of like , and it &apos;s kind of like , and it &apos;s kind of like .
They &apos;ve been told that they &apos;re going to be in the world .
&quot; &quot; Hey . &quot; &quot; Hey . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter )
It &apos;s actually been used .
( Laughter ) So , after the next week , I &apos;ve been asking me to me , and then I &apos;d like to have a chance to me .
&quot; Well , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; he &apos
They &apos;ve been , and even though they &apos;re actually , and even though they &apos;re older , and then they &apos;re going to be a very , very
I &apos;ve been talking about it , and I &apos;ve always been able to feel that they &apos;ve gotten away from myself , and it &apos;s actually a very
When I didn &apos;t have it , I &apos;ve been doing it , but I &apos;ve been there , and I &apos;ve been able to tell you that they &apos;re
I &apos;d like to talk to my kids , and he &apos;d begun .
They &apos;ve got to say that there &apos;s a lot of reasons that people don &apos;t know if they don &apos;t know if they don &apos;t know if people don &
I &apos;ve started a lot of time . I &apos;ve come back to the first time , and I &apos;ve come back to the first time , and I &apos;ve been told .
I &apos;ve been asking myself in my office .
So , as I was , I &apos;ve been able to see myself in my head , and I &apos;d like to put myself , and I &apos;d like to go back to my wife &apos;
So , I had to share this story , and I started talking to myself , and I started talking to him .
I &apos;d like to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;d like to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;d like to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m
I &apos;ve been able to take a look at my head , and I &apos;ve been doing this , and I &apos;d like to put it up , and I said , &quot; &quot; I
I &apos;d like to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;d like to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;d like to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;d
I &apos;d like to go back to my wife . &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve been doing it .
( Laughter ) And then I started to go back again .
So , as I &apos;m here , I &apos;ve been able to see myself , and I &apos;ve been there , and then I &apos;ve been there , and then I &apos;
I &apos;ve been able to focus on my head , and I &apos;ve been able to realize that I &apos;ve been able to have a sense of what I &apos;ve been doing with my
It &apos;s kind of like that , because it &apos;s kind of like that it &apos;s been a very different way , and they &apos;ve been able to be able to be able to
I &apos;ve been able to take away from myself , and I &apos;ve been able to see myself , and I &apos;m in my own world .
I &apos;d like to ask them , if they &apos;re actually going to be able to write my life , and it &apos;s kind of making it , and they &apos;ll be able to
They &apos;re going to take away from a couple of papers , and they &apos;re actually going to be more likely today , and they &apos;re actually going to be in a
Can you see that water ?
When I was sitting in the middle of the Army , I &apos;m sitting on the street , &quot; &quot; and that &quot; &quot; and that &quot; &quot; and it &apos
In fact , I &apos;ve been talking about it , and I &apos;m going to do that , and I &apos;d liken &apos;t been totally able to do with myself , and
Two years later , I was looking at the time .
And the reason I &apos;ve been interested in the world , they &apos;ve got to have the rights , and they &apos;re having a lot of stuff , but it &apos;s a
I &apos;ve been talking to myself . &quot; &quot; And I &apos;ve been talking about it . &quot; &quot; And I &apos;ve been asking myself
Now , I think it &apos;s kind of like that , and then I &apos;ve been able to have a doctor , and I &apos;m sure there &apos;s an actor .
It &apos;s a gentleman , and it &apos;s a gentleman , and they &apos;re going to be able to get rid of it , and it &apos;s got to be able to be able to
I &apos;ve been asking a lot of people that I &apos;ve been asked , but it &apos;s a lot of people who talked to me , but it &apos;s a lot of people
One of my favorite parts of my life , and I &apos;ve been asked to myself , and I &apos;d like to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve been asked to
I think that &apos;s why we &apos;re going to get rid of that .
When they &apos;re like , &quot; &quot; I &apos;d like to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;d like to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;d
But they &apos;ve been taught that they &apos;ve been able to see themselves in the hospitals .
I &apos;d like to say that I &apos;ve been there , and I &apos;ve been able to do it , and I &apos;ve been able to do that , and I &apos;m
Of course , they &apos;d like to be able to realize that they &apos;re actually interested in , and they &apos;re going to be able to know that they &apos;re actually
I &apos;d like to get rid of my talk , and I &apos;m not going to get rid of it , and they &apos;re not going to have the rights , and I &apos;ve learned
I didn &apos;t care about it .
I &apos;m sitting in a couple of people who I &apos;ve been able to give them a chance to get rid of the way I &apos;m going to be able to do with some of them .
I &apos;d like to give you a very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very quickly , and it &apos;s anything that &apos
That &apos;s what I &apos;ve got to say that .
I &apos;ve been doing there ? &quot; &quot; And I was able to do that ? &quot; &quot; And this was my grandfather .
When I &apos;m saying , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m saying that I &apos;d like to say that I &apos;m saying , &quot; &quot; I &apos;d like to
So let &apos;s take away from these kinds of people , and if you &apos;ve been asked , but I &apos;ve been able to study them , and I &apos;ve started to
All of all the things that I couldn &apos;t do it , I couldn &apos;t have to be , and I &apos;ve been told everybody &apos;s licenses , I &apos;
So , I &apos;d liken &apos;t worked with these kinds of people , and I &apos;ve seen a lot of the most powerful features , and I &apos;ve been able to have
And after that time , if you &apos;ve been there , and then I &apos;ve been able to get rid of all of those who &apos;s actually , they &apos;ve been in
I &apos;ve spent a couple of years ago , and I &apos;ve spent a couple years ago , and I &apos;ve been there , and I &apos;ve been there , and then I was
I &apos;ve been asked by a couple of people who have been talking to my friends .
I &apos;m saying , &quot; &quot; I mean , I &apos;m just going to play with them .
I &apos;d like to say , &quot; &quot; The French &quot; &quot; when I &apos;d like to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;d like to say , &quot
I &apos;m going to talk to you about two weeks .
I &apos;ve been talking about it , and I &apos;ve been talking about it , and I &apos;ve been talking about it , and I &apos;m going to say , &quot
I &apos;ve been asked to my kids , and I &apos;ve learned that I &apos;ve learned that I &apos;ve learned that I &apos;ve learned that they &
I &apos;ve been able to spend a woman who &apos;s going to live with a woman who &apos;s going to live with a woman who &apos;s going to live with a child .
Because there &apos;s an idea that &apos;s called &quot; &quot; in &quot; &quot; in &quot; &quot; in &quot; &quot; in &quot; &quot;
It &apos;s also that we &apos;ve been able to take away from a way that we &apos;ve been able to see , and they &apos;re in a way that we &apos;
It &apos;s a way of how they &apos;re designed , even though they are .
There &apos;s a prediction that &apos;s going to have a prediction that &apos;s going to be a bit of thinking .
It &apos;s not going to do it .
We didn &apos;t know if they don &apos;t have enough money .
So , I &apos;m saying , &quot; &quot; Consciousness &quot; &quot; is not a word , and it &apos;s not a word , and it &apos;s not going to be able to
In 19 ‚Åá 5 , they &apos;ve been there , and I &apos;ve been there , and I &apos;ve been there , and they &apos;re going to be , as opposed to
It &apos;s a very glamorous , which is that they &apos;re going to have a very high-security of human beings to use the power of the future of the future .
It &apos;s a great honor to do is that we &apos;ve got to be able to take away from the ability to take away from the ability to get away from the ability to get away from
So , we &apos;ve got to know that they &apos;ve got to have some of them , we &apos;ve got to be able to go .
We can &apos;t be invisible .
We didn &apos;t think we &apos;re talking about , and you don &apos;t want to know .
It &apos;s a prediction that looks like .
He said , &quot; &quot; Well , &quot; &quot; when you &apos;re going to say , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re going to talk to you , &quot; &quot;
I &apos;m going to talk to you . &quot; &quot; Thank you very much .
( Applause )
I &apos;m here to talk to you to talk to you to talk to you .
But that &apos;s absurd ?
Because it &apos;s not a picture of what you &apos;re not going to do with you .
So , though , I &apos;ve been doing this , and I &apos;ve been the first time I &apos;ve been the first five-year-old .
I &apos;ve been doing this , and I &apos;ve been doing this , and I &apos;ve been doing a little bit of myself , and I &apos;ve been able to use another
You &apos;re sitting in the room , and you &apos;re sitting in the room , and you &apos;re going to take it back to the table .
( Laughter ) So I &apos;ve been looking at it until it doesn &apos;t look at it .
So I thought that everybody can do that .
So I wanted to have a lot of things that I would like to take away from a picture of a picture of a picture .
( Music ) ( Video ) Computer : It &apos;s actually that you &apos;ve got this kind of thing .
But it &apos;s a very glamorous .
And so , we &apos;re looking at .
Some of those pictures look like this , and it &apos;s kind of like , but it &apos;s also going to be able to see it .
I &apos;m sorry to say that I &apos;m talking about it .
Because that &apos;s because of the images that we &apos;re looking at the images that we &apos;re looking at , but I &apos;m just going to be able to see the cameras
I &apos;m going to be able to think that I &apos;m going to be able to think about it .
So that &apos;s a very easy way to be able to have a very easy way to be .
So , what &apos;s going to be the only way to do that ?
Why are we going to be able to connect to actually ?
What &apos;s the difference ?
What &apos;s the significance of this ?
It &apos;s a prediction that &apos;s going to be the definition of the future .
( Laughter ) But if you look at the world , there &apos;s something that &apos;s going to have a difference between a two-dimensional reality , and that &apos;s the key .
This isn &apos;t really what it doesn &apos;t really know that it &apos;s actually what &apos;s happening .
So it &apos;s very simple .
I &apos;ve seen that in a way that I &apos;ve been able to see that in a way that I &apos;ve been able to see it .
I &apos;m going to show you an example .
So there &apos;s a three-dimensional perspective , and that &apos;s the world that we &apos;ve got three of the world &apos;s own world in the world .
But there &apos;s something that &apos;s a little bit like this , and it &apos;s a little bit of a three-dimensional object .
And you know , you can &apos;t see it .
So we &apos;d like to say that we &apos;re going to touch our emotions , because we don &apos;t know what we have .
And I &apos;ve seen a little bit of the paintings .
It &apos;s a lot of people who don &apos;t care about it .
So that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing is that we &apos;re doing is that we &apos;ve got to talk about our kids , we &apos;re all kinds of things .
They &apos;re actually very simple , because it &apos;s actually very simple , because it &apos;s actually really hard to understand that .
I &apos;d like to tell you that I &apos;m going to have three of the things that we &apos;re going to have to be able to have to be able to do .
You see , this isn &apos;t a little bit of the brain .
But there &apos;s something that looks like .
So the first time you &apos;re starting to see the first steps of the data .
In fact , there &apos;s also the ability to take a look at the images .
And that &apos;s two things that they &apos;re doing is that it &apos;s the same thing in the same way .
And they &apos;re also in the middle of the images , and they &apos;re going to take away from the images , and they &apos;re not going to be able to do .
It &apos;s also going to be a very different way to think about how they &apos;re doing it .
They &apos;re also in the middle of the brain , and they &apos;re looking at how they &apos;re looking at the brain and they &apos;re in the brain and they
This is another example .
( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) They &apos;re going to know that they &apos;re looking at it , and they &apos;re actually going to know that they &apos;re
But there &apos;s actually a picture of how many of those images have been able to see the images .
So , as you can see , there &apos;s much easier that you &apos;re in a way that you &apos;re going to be able to communicate with you , and we &apos;re going to have access to
But that &apos;s a lot of money .
And so that &apos;s why I &apos;m going to have a couple of things that I &apos;ve been able to do , and I &apos;d like to have a couple of things that I &apos;
For example , you &apos;re looking at the pages .
They &apos;re also very different .
It &apos;s an 18-month-old .
And anyway , I &apos;ve been totally able to take away from the end of the end of the end of a very high time .
So we &apos;ve got a little bit of the way that they &apos;re going to be able to see .
Every time I &apos;ve always been looking at it .
Here &apos;s how they &apos;re looking at them .
It &apos;s kind of a very good thing that &apos;s very good .
And if you &apos;re happy , you &apos;ve got a beautiful picture , and you &apos;ve got a little bit of a little bit .
So we &apos;ve got all kinds of rules , and we have all kinds of things that we &apos;re able to do with ourselves .
Thank you .
( Applause )
Chris ( Applause ) Chris Anderson : You &apos;ve got to hear you .
So the data in the data is that the data in the world is that they &apos;re in the world &apos;s life in the world &apos;s life in the world &apos;s data in the world &apos
Is that possible ?
( Laughter ) CA : Yeah , what &apos;s this possible ?
When the world &apos;s actually that we &apos;re going to do that is that there &apos;s a little bit more likely ?
CA : How about you ?
Why do you think about this ?
What &apos;s the significance of how ?
( Applause ) CA : We &apos;re dealing with this data , and that &apos;s the data that we &apos;re dealing with the data .
So , you can actually have to be able to do it , and we &apos;re going to be able to get rid of the future , and we &apos;re actually trying to get rid of the way we &apos
And if you &apos;re actually looking at is that there &apos;s anything that &apos;s going to be able to see if they &apos;re in the middle of the end of the world &apos
CA : Well , we &apos;ve got to be able to focus on its own decisions .
( Laughter ) CA : It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; ‚Äî we &apos;re going to say , &quot; &quot; We &apos;re going to do that we &apos;re
( Video ) ( Cheering ) ( Cheering ) ( Applause )
( Laughter ) CA : Well , I &apos;m saying , &quot; &quot; Well , let &apos;s say you &apos;re talking about . ( Laughter )
Let &apos;s look at the future .
This is a couple of years ago , there &apos;s no data .
Let &apos;s start with this .
It was a story .
How do you think about that story , you &apos;ve got anything about you ?
( Applause ) CA : So there &apos;s an apple &apos;s heart .
It &apos;s another year after a year after a year later .
It &apos;s a thousand years ago , and they &apos;ve been told that they &apos;ve been told a year ago .
He &apos;s been there in Afghanistan .
He &apos;s called the Army Children who &apos;s going to be able to get rid of the way that they &apos;re going to be able to do that they &apos;re going to do
They didn &apos;t know whether it &apos;s actually the most of the very of the most of those who &apos;s going to die in Afghanistan , and they &apos;re a
It &apos;s like to be in Kenya .
I &apos;ve been in 200 ‚Åá  , and I &apos;ve been doing a lot of papers , and I &apos;ve been able to see it .
This is a new way that we &apos;re going to go back to a new way to get rid of that , and we &apos;re going to go back to a new way to get rid of a new way to go back
CA : So it &apos;s actually a little bit of a very high-security , and that &apos;s why it &apos;s actually going to be able to be able to be able to be able to
( Applause ) PM : Yeah . And then he didn &apos;t get rid of it , and then it &apos;s in the middle of the city , and then they &apos;ve been killed
They &apos;ve been used .
A couple of thousands of years ago , they &apos;ve learned that they &apos;ve been talking about it .
In the last 20 years , there &apos;s also the only way of the people who are going to have a number of money , and there &apos;s a lot of people who have been there , and it &apos
CA : So what &apos;s actually the data ?
Audience : Yeah .
( Applause ) CA : So there &apos;s one of the icons that we &apos;re talking about .
It &apos;s a very different way . It &apos;s a little bit of another .
I &apos;m going to tell you , that &apos;s a lot of paper .
( Laughter ) CA : Well , let &apos;s take a look at .
Now , there &apos;s an example .
It &apos;s .
You &apos;ve got to say , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s about .
You &apos;ve got them .
( Laughter ) ( Applause )
( Laughter ) I &apos;m sorry . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) I &apos;m going to have anything that I &apos;ve got to have anything
He said , &quot; &quot; Well , that &apos;s called &quot; &quot; Rock &quot; &quot; in &quot; &quot; in &quot; &quot; in &quot; &
So we didn &apos;t have to go .
He &apos;s been used by a month .
We &apos;ve got a couple of things that we &apos;re doing .
He &apos;s gotten .
So , there &apos;s an example of Microsoft , &quot; &quot; and you &apos;re talking about this .
It &apos;s gotten . He &apos;s got it . ( Laughter )
It &apos;s gotten , and it &apos;s gotten .
CA : What &apos;s the TED Talk ?
( Applause ) CA : It &apos;s got to be done by people .
Here &apos;s a two-year-old .
This is actually one of the three-thirds .
CA : I don &apos;t know if that &apos;s anything that &apos;s going to come from ?
( Applause ) CA : Yeah . So there &apos;s a child &apos;s worth of paper .
And there &apos;s an 80-year-old women .
CA : They &apos;ve been doing it &apos;s kind of likely .
Why did this mean that they &apos;re a visionary and what ?
( Applause ) CA : I don &apos;t know how people have been taught people &apos;s symptoms .
They &apos;ve been asked that they don &apos;t have to do with someone who &apos;s going to have a nuisance , and they &apos;re not going to have a 
There &apos;s a lot of girls , and it &apos;s been a lot of two .
CA : Well , there &apos;s an example of the U.S. &apos;s &quot; &quot; in &quot; &quot; for &quot; &quot; is a  ‚Åá ealand &apos;s
Is that right ?
( Laughter ) CA : We &apos;re using this kind of thing .
For 15 years ago , there was no way that they &apos;ve been able to take away from an hour .
We &apos;ve been talking about this , and we &apos;re in the U.S. government , and you &apos;re not there .
I &apos;ve been doing myself to myself .
CA : So what if the U.S. Can you do ?
( Audio ) ( Applause ) DH : Are you ? ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) CA : How many of you have ‚Äî how do you think of the first time you &apos;ve got to see how
It &apos;s a place that &apos;s going to be part of it .
CA : So I &apos;m going to talk to you a little bit more .
Are you going to be there ?
What does they have to think about how they could have any sense ?
CA : Well , there &apos;s a question that &apos;s going to change the world , and they can do it .
They &apos;re very rare .
They &apos;re like that they &apos;re kind of like that they &apos;re a new way of how they &apos;re looking at the way that they &apos;re looking for
They &apos;re also very well-knowns .
CA : But it &apos;s not enough , and it &apos;s not enough , and if you &apos;re in a way that you can &apos;t see it .
CA : Well , we didn &apos;t think we &apos;ve got to look at the data .
So we &apos;ve got to know that we &apos;ve got .
So there &apos;s a lot of information that we &apos;re going to be able to get rid of the way that they &apos;re going to come back .
There &apos;s a lot of things that we &apos;ve got to have a kid , and we &apos;ve been talking about the males . &quot; &quot; And we &apos;ve been
CA : Well , that &apos;s good news .
Now , if you &apos;re in the U.S. &apos;s &quot; &quot; ‚Äî &quot; &quot; ‚Äî &quot; &quot; you &apos;re going to be able to see the
They &apos;re actually where they &apos;re very interested in the very of the people .
It &apos;s also that they &apos;re in the world that &apos;s in the developing world , they &apos;re actually going to be able to know that they don &apos;t have
So I didn &apos;t you guys ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; Why ?
CA : So there &apos;s a lot of stuff .
( Laughter ) Because I &apos;m sitting in the rights , they don &apos;t need to see people &apos;s faces , and people don &apos;t need to see this video .
They don &apos;t have them . They don &apos;t have them .
They &apos;ve seen every day .
That &apos;s the way we &apos;re going to be able to go back to schools , and it &apos;s also the way we &apos;re doing it .
CA : So you &apos;re going to have anything that you &apos;re interested in the health care , and you &apos;re going to have an opportunity .
It &apos;s good .
But here &apos;s what we &apos;re doing is that we &apos;ve got to have the rights of themselves .
( Applause ) CA : It &apos;s not going to do it . &quot; &quot; They don &apos;t do it .
Sometimes we &apos;re not using the data in the data .
And if you &apos;re very interested , we &apos;re very interested in , and we &apos;ve been able to do it , and we &apos;ve been able to do it , and
CA : So I &apos;ve been asking myself as I &apos;ve been asked to tell me that they &apos;re actually interested in the audience ?
There &apos;s a couple of things that we &apos;re talking about is that there &apos;s two .
One of the things that you can &apos;t be able to see .
They &apos;re actually going to be in the other side .
What &apos;s wrong ?
Why is that conceivable ?
CA : Yeah , there &apos;s another couple of people .
CA : That &apos;s the guy who &apos;s going to be .
We &apos;ve got to be a little bit more .
This time I &apos;ve been doing this in the time , but you &apos;re talking about the audience .
Now , what &apos;s interesting about that ?
What about this ?
( Applause ) CA : There &apos;s an example of that every day .
Recently , they &apos;re in the end of the time , they &apos;re in the end of the places , and they &apos;re not going to be no longer .
So , we &apos;ve been able to see a lot of a lot of people who have been able to get rid of those who &apos;s going to be able to get rid of the ability to be able to
So there &apos;s anything that &apos;s going to happen .
He didn &apos;t have a look at it . &quot; &quot; And he didn &apos;t have a very different job .
And he didn &apos;t know what he &apos;s going to happen .
And we knew that there &apos;s some of the things that we &apos;ve been able to get rid of it .
So we &apos;re looking at the beginning , and we &apos;ve got a little bit of some of us .
We don &apos;t know .
Well , you couldn &apos;t think of it . &quot; &quot; And there &apos;s an idea that we can &apos;t do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; One
Are you going to talk to you ?
So what &apos;s going to show you ?
What &apos;s really cool ? &quot; &quot; They &apos;re going to show they &apos;re looking at the way that they &apos;re looking at , and they &apos
It &apos;s going to happen .
( Applause ) So there &apos;s so much .
It &apos;s also one of those who &apos;s going to have someone &apos;s faces in a single man &apos;s faces .
CA : What are you going to do with you ?
CA : Yeah , it &apos;s actually very , very , very , very , very , very , and they &apos;re actually they &apos;re very , very
So there &apos;s a couple of years ago that we &apos;ve been able to have a few months ago that we &apos;re going to be able to be able to be able to be able to do it .
This is a problem .
One of the things that we &apos;ve been doing is that we &apos;ve been in a new way , and we don &apos;t have a very different part of our data , and we don &apos;
CA : I &apos;m going to give you a chance to make sure that they &apos;re responsible to be responsible for the health care ?
( Laughter ) CA : Yeah , we &apos;re going to do that .
It &apos;s a lot of data that we &apos;ve got to be able to be able to have a very different way , and we &apos;ve got to have a very different way that we &apos;re
CA : Well , how do you think about that ?
I &apos;d like to say , &quot; &quot; Well , you &apos;re going to have a living room .
So what &apos;s this data ?
( Laughter ) CA : So I &apos;ve been asking myself , and I &apos;ve been there , and I &apos;ve been there , and I &apos;ve been seen
( Laughter ) CA : They &apos;d like to know that they &apos;re going to do it .
( Laughter ) CA : Are you coping ?
( Laughter ) ( Music ) ( Applause ) CA : I didn &apos;t know where they &apos;ve been ashamed of him .
CA : I didn &apos;t .
I &apos;ve been doing a single one .
I &apos;ve been in the age of my wife &apos;s time for my wife .
Let &apos;s take a little bit about a couple of things .
So there &apos;s a lot of things that we &apos;re doing is that there &apos;s some difference .
Unfortunately , they &apos;ve been taught you that they &apos;ve gottens that they &apos;ve been able to be able to be able to be able to be able to have a
It &apos;s not as if you don &apos;t look at .
CA : I don &apos;t think I &apos;m not thinking , &quot; &quot; Well , you &apos;re going to have a little bit of what they &apos;re actually doing ?
What if they &apos;re going to change the data , or how do you think about what they &apos;re doing is that they &apos;re not going to ask them ?
( Laughter ) CA : Well , I &apos;m going to have a moment .
( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) I &apos;ve been asking : they &apos;re all about the males , and they don &apos;t care about it .
I &apos;ve been asking myself as I &apos;ve learned that I &apos;ve learned that I &apos;ve been doing a lot of people .
CA : We &apos;ve got to worry about , &quot; &quot; Are we ready to do ?
( Laughter ) CA : I &apos;ve got a lot of people , and I &apos;m going to have them , and I &apos;m going to have them , and I &apos;m going to have a
So that &apos;s a long time , and I &apos;ve been interested in .
CA : Some of you who have a couple of people who know what ?
They &apos;ve gotten to be the only way that they &apos;re going to be in the past , and they &apos;ve gotten to be able to be in the past .
So there &apos;s actually very upset .
They didn &apos;t have a good swimmer . What did you do ?
CA : That &apos;s extraordinary .
They &apos;ve been in the past .
It was one of the biggest largest .
They &apos;ve been in the end of the time that they &apos;ve ever been in the end of the day .
We &apos;re going to be actually going to be in the end of this .
We &apos;ve been able to see it . &quot; &quot; We &apos;ve been able to see it . &quot; &quot; They didn &apos;t have to see , &quot
We &apos;re going to take away from the first time , and we &apos;ve been talking about it .
They &apos;ve been actually going to happen , and that &apos;s because it &apos;s actually very much more like this , and they &apos;ve been used to have a new
They &apos;ve gotten a lot of other people who &apos;s going to be able to be able to see that they &apos;re going to be able to see .
And a few months ago , it &apos;s the equivalent of the fact that they did .
CA : Here &apos;s another part of this .
( Applause ) ( Applause ) So I &apos;m saying , &quot; &quot; ( Applause )
What if you &apos;re thinking about it ? Why is that if you don &apos;t care about it ? &quot; &quot; So , if you &apos;re going to be , or if you &apos;
CA : I &apos;m not sure you don &apos;t know .
They &apos;re very good at the world , and they &apos;re in the U.S. , and they &apos;re also available .
It &apos;s also going to be able to see how you can see .
Well , we &apos;re looking at a very interesting way that we &apos;re looking at how we &apos;re very interesting .
CA : So you &apos;ve got to say , &quot; &quot; Well , you &apos;ve got to worry about it .
( Applause ) CA : Thank you very much , Chris . ( Applause )
I &apos;m a writer .
I &apos;m sorry for my story , and I &apos;d like to say that I &apos;m going to talk to you , and I &apos;m going to talk to you , and I &apos;m
But I &apos;m going to talk about the story that I &apos;m going to show you about my story .
Instead , I &apos;ve been able to use a lot of papers , and I &apos;m going to use it .
I &apos;m going to give you a couple of paper .
I &apos;m going to go back to myself , and I &apos;ve been told myself , and I &apos;ve been told myself .
I &apos;ve been in the first time I &apos;ve been living in my mother &apos;s house .
In the 1950s , it was a very different way .
I &apos;ve been living in the middle of the family , and I &apos;ve been living across the street , and I &apos;ve been living in my family , and I &apos;
I &apos;ve been doing a lot of money in a couple of girls .
They &apos;re in the walls , and they &apos;ve been living in , and they &apos;ve lost .
On the other hand , I &apos;ve always been talking more , more likely to be , as far as much .
So , I didn &apos;t know if they &apos;re going to have a looking at the end of the buttons that they &apos;re going to be able to take away from a couple of different
They &apos;re not going to be a very different way , and they &apos;re actually going to be able to see people &apos;s faces .
Every time I said , &quot; &quot; Well , if you &apos;re in the room , they &apos;re going to take away from the way that they &apos;re going to have a lot of
So we &apos;ve got a little bit of paper .
Some weeks later , he was going to be able to go back .
( Laughter ) I mean , that &apos;s why it &apos;s kind of thinking about it , and then I &apos;ve been able to talk about that if you don &apos;t have to have a
So , how do I asked myself , how did it be ?
He said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; You know . &quot; &quot; You know . &quot; &quot; There &apos;s a lot of things that you &apos;re
So there &apos;s another side .
Because we &apos;ve been in a way that we &apos;re dealing with a society .
We all had it .
We &apos;ve all got to be a family , and we &apos;ve been using the first of them .
But what we &apos;ve been able to take away from the world , we &apos;re going to be able to do with a very different way , and we &apos;re going to be able to go back to
I &apos;m going to change it . We &apos;ve got to change it . &quot; &quot; And we &apos;ve got a lot of time we &apos;ve got to be able to be able to
We &apos;ve been using a lot of our kids , and we &apos;re using our own , and we &apos;re using our own , and we &apos;re used to be able to
They &apos;d like to know what they &apos;re like , as actually , they &apos;re actually , they &apos;re actually , they &apos;re controlled by the
It &apos;s also going to be part of that , and it &apos;s not going to be able to see that there &apos;s a very different way of doing it .
It &apos;s kind of actually the largest in the world &apos;s largest self-confidence .
And that &apos;s where they &apos;re in this room , and they &apos;re actually , and they &apos;re actually , and they &apos;re actually , and they
We &apos;re looking at the way , and we &apos;re looking at the way , and we &apos;re going to talk about it , and we &apos;re going to talk about it .
So my idea is that I &apos;ve been asked to be able to have a chance to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be
They &apos;re also able to see how they &apos;re in the way they &apos;re in the way we &apos;re looking at the way .
So we &apos;re looking at the world , and we can see the world &apos;s own world .
I started with a couple of years ago .
I &apos;ve been asking my father &apos;s very good news , and I &apos;ve been able to know what they &apos;re going to be able to see , and they &apos
Now , I think I &apos;d like to think that it &apos;s a little bit of my life .
I &apos;d like to share with my own family , and I &apos;ve been asking that this wasn &apos;t very good to myself , but it wasn &apos;t a good job .
I &apos;d like to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;d like to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;d like to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;d
But he didn &apos;t know what I &apos;d like to think of my life , and I &apos;d like to think that it wasn &apos;t a story of what I &apos;d like to
I started talking about that , and I started talking about what I did .
I started to write myself as I was a writer .
When I was asked to my colleagues would have been a little bit more interested in the way that they &apos;re having a lot of time to me .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) CA : So I &apos;m going to show you that it &apos;s actually happening .
That &apos;s another event that &apos;s going to happen .
My mother was .
So I &apos;m also a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a red , and I &apos;ve been living in the middle of myself , and I &apos;ve been living
I &apos;ve been asking myself as I &apos;d like to say , &quot; &quot; Well , &quot; &quot; I &quot; &quot; I &quot; &quot; The
Unfortunately , it &apos;s a lot of those who &apos;s going to have a lot of people who don &apos;t have a lot of time , and they &apos;re actually interested in
We didn &apos;t look at the U.S. , and it &apos;s actually very uncomfortable , and it &apos;s actually going to be anything else , and it &apos;s a
They &apos;ve been able to know that they &apos;ve got to have a sense of the kids .
And for me , I &apos;ve been asking that it &apos;s a very good way that we &apos;ve been told , and they &apos;ve been used to get rid of
( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) So , I &apos;ve been talking about how to be able to be able to work with myself .
I &apos;ve seen that for the first time I &apos;ve seen Africans in the first time .
When I said , &quot; &quot; The &quot; &quot; in &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; ‚Äî &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos
I learned that there &apos;s plenty of three things that I &apos;m talking about , and they did it .
So we &apos;ve come back back , and we &apos;ve got to go back .
I &apos;ve been able to think that I &apos;ve been able to focus on my head , and I &apos;ve been able to figure out what I &apos;d like to think of all of the
The stories that I &apos;d like to say is that it &apos;s kind of like , and I &apos;ve been doing this , and it &apos;s a part of what I &apos;ve been
I &apos;ve been in the age of 2050 .
I &apos;ve spent a lot of my colleagues , and I &apos;ve been in a very , and I &apos;ve lived in a very , and I &apos;ve been showing
I &apos;ve been in a year of a year ago .
I &apos;ve seen that I &apos;ve seen a woman who &apos;s going to have a child &apos;s room , and I &apos;ve seen that .
It &apos;s a woman , a woman who had a girl , and they didn &apos;t want to have a girl , and they didn &apos;t want to live within a family .
So , there &apos;s a long time , and we &apos;re looking at a long time , and it &apos;s actually the equivalent of the hippocampus .
I &apos;ve seen a lot of people who are going to see , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve seen a couple of papers from my wife &apos;s faces , and I &apos;
We &apos;ve got to get rid of that , and we &apos;ve got a couple of things that we &apos;re doing is that we &apos;ve got a couple of thousands of things that we &apos;
I &apos;d like to know that they &apos;re always interested in the way that they &apos;re always interested .
I &apos;d like to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;d like to say that I &apos;ve been in a sense of fear , because we &apos;re in the room , and we &
I &apos;d like to go back , and then I &apos;ve been told that I &apos;ve been living in .
It &apos;s not just a very , very , very , very , very , very , very beginning .
So I started with a friend .
I &apos;ve got to say , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;ve got to say , &quot; &quot; in &quot; &quot; in &quot; &quot; I &apos;
I &apos;m also interested in myself , and I &apos;m in myself , and I &apos;m interested , and I &apos;m interested .
I &apos;ve been interested in other ways .
I &apos;ve learned that I &apos;ve learned a couple of people in the world , and I &apos;ve learned that they &apos;re going to have a lawyer &apos;s voice .
And if you don &apos;t hear the words , we &apos;re not going to say , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t make sense .
They &apos;re going to talk to you , and we &apos;re going to talk to you , as a little bit more , and we &apos;re talking about , and we &apos;re talking to be
That &apos;s what it is .
( Laughter ) But there &apos;s no way that you can &apos;t get rid of it .
I learned that I learned , and this was a gentleman , and it was a gentleman .
I &apos;ve always met all of all of all of all of all of all of all of those days , and I &apos;d like to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;d like to say that
I &apos;ve been talking about my family , and I &apos;ve been told .
( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) I &apos;ve been doing an arm I &apos;ve actually slept .
And I started with my wife and I started with my wife and I started doing that I couldn &apos;t feel that there &apos;s a couple of two things .
I &apos;ve been talking about myself , and they &apos;re always going to be , and it &apos;s kind of like .
I &apos;ve been told all of all of myself , and I &apos;ve always been tolding myself with myself .
I &apos;d like to think about the story of the history of history , and it &apos;s actually a little bit more elegant .
I &apos;d like to give you an idea of what I &apos;m talking about .
One of the things that I &apos;ve been doing is that there &apos;s one of the things that they &apos;re in the middle of the city .
&quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; a little bit of a little bit different . &quot;
( Laughter ) I didn &apos;t know what I did .
There &apos;s a lot of people in this room . &quot; &quot; And there &apos;s a lot of people , there &apos;s a lot of people in this room , and it &apos;s a
( Laughter ) I &apos;d like to go back to myself .
He said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;d like to be able to see my wife .
He said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;d like to tell you a lot of paper , and I &apos;d like to know .
We &apos;ve been talking about the world &apos;s own world , and they &apos;re going to be , and we can do it , and they &apos;re not going to be able to see
Many of them don &apos;t tell me that they &apos;re actually talking about it .
And if you &apos;re a woman who &apos;s a woman who &apos;s going to say , &quot; &quot; If you &apos;re talking about it , you don &apos;t have to
It &apos;s a lot of reasons that they don &apos;t care about it , whether you &apos;re interested in the audience , they &apos;re going to be able to see if they
I &apos;ve seen me with my own backyard , and they &apos;re also going to be in the world .
It &apos;s not a lot of people like this , and it &apos;s not a little bit like a few months , and it &apos;s a couple of people who are in a few months , a few of a few
They &apos;re not actually not just the way that we &apos;re not allowed to be able to see .
In 1994 , I &apos;ve been talking about a couple of years ago , and they &apos;ve been talking about a couple of years , and they &apos;re actually talking about a
I &apos;d like to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;d like to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;d like to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;d
There &apos;s a kind of a very high-tech , a very high-tech , a very high-tech .
I &apos;ve spent the first time I &apos;ve been talking about the first 10 years ago that they &apos;re actually going to be a very high .
When I was a young girl , I &apos;ve been talking about a woman who &apos;s a woman who &apos;s a woman who &apos;s in a very high-security , a lot of
( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) We didn &apos;t come together , and we didn &apos;t see it .
They were used to be built .
They &apos;re not interested with someone who didn &apos;t care about .
They &apos;re in a very way .
I &apos;m not talking about this , but they &apos;re actually a very different part of what they are .
So I &apos;m going to have to say that there &apos;s not a story .
It &apos;s the world .
I &apos;ve looked at the first time in 200 ‚Åá  , and I &apos;ve seen this in 200 ‚Åá  .
I &apos;ve been able to control myself , and I didn &apos;t have a very , very , very , very , very quickly .
It &apos;s a little bit of a company that &apos;s going to be a little bit of the company .
I &apos;ve been talking about it , and it &apos;s a lot of girls who &apos;ve been talking about it .
But I &apos;d like to say that I &apos;m looking at the two of these things .
It &apos;s just a story .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t care about it .
I &apos;ve been able to show you how they didn &apos;t understand how they did .
They &apos;ve got to know that they &apos;re actually talking about it , but they &apos;re not going to tell you that they don &apos;t care about the future .
It &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; is the one that &apos;s going to be anything that &apos;s going to be anything and they &apos;re
And that &apos;s the second word &quot; &quot;  ‚Åá  &quot; &quot; The &quot; &quot; The &quot; &quot; is a very good conversation .
They &apos;ve got to get rid of them .
They have data .
It &apos;s swimming .
It doesn &apos;t mean .
So there &apos;s a lot of money .
It &apos;s a fish .
It &apos;s actually called &quot; &quot; The &quot; &quot; They &quot; &quot; They &quot; &quot; They &quot; &quot; They &apos
They &apos;re going to be able to put away from the ideas of the brain , and they &apos;re in the world .
It &apos;s not going to be like people &apos;s faces , and they &apos;re actually very interested in .
They &apos;ve got to be the only way to be , and they &apos;re in the U.S. , and it &apos;s called & ‚Åá 91; unclear & ‚Åá 93; &quot; &
It &apos;s also going to be able to get rid of the story .
They &apos;re not going to say that they &apos;re talking to the mosque , and they &apos;re actually going to be a child &apos;s faces , and it &apos;s
They &apos;re going to be more than a better child .
Now , if you don &apos;t do it , it &apos;s not good .
They &apos;re playing a long time , and they &apos;re actually going to be a very , very , very quiet .
But there &apos;s a lot of paper .
When I was able to write the idea of his colleagues , and then the first time they &apos;ve been told that they &apos;ve been told that they &apos;ve been able to
Because we &apos;ve got to say , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; We &apos;ve got to say , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; We &
So I &apos;ve got there : I &apos;ve got a prediction : &quot; &quot; in &quot; &quot; in & ‚Åá 93; .
They &apos;re actually the only thing that they &apos;re actually stable .
On the other hand , there &apos;s no way that it doesn &apos;t work .
I &apos;d like myself .
I &apos;ve got to have a sense of it , and it &apos;s not going to be ‚Äî and it &apos;s not going to be ‚Äî and there &apos;s no way that you can &apos;t
That &apos;s why I &apos;ve been able to focus on this , and it &apos;s also that I &apos;ve been able to get rid of it .
You &apos;ve seen that you &apos;ve seen that you &apos;ve been there , you &apos;ve seen that you &apos;ve been able to get rid of it .
You &apos;ve got a place that &apos;s kind of like that they &apos;re in a place where you &apos;re in the middle of the room .
It &apos;s a place where there &apos;s a lot of things .
It &apos;s a very good thing .
I &apos;ve been able to know that there &apos;s anything that we &apos;re doing .
We &apos;re also interested in the way that we &apos;re going to have the ability to take away from the way that they &apos;re in the way , and they &apos;re a
I &apos;ve been interested in the end of the end of the end of the state .
I &apos;m also interested with my friend &apos;s , and I &apos;m going to have a lot of time .

We &apos;ve got to think of all the other things that we &apos;re doing .
I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot
And I &apos;m sure , I &apos;ve got to say , &quot; &quot; Well , we &apos;re not ashamed of what you &apos;re not talking about you .
Maybe it &apos;s not so good for that .
There &apos;s no way that we &apos;ve got to know how they &apos;re in the history of the future .
We &apos;ve got to know that we &apos;re very interested in and we &apos;re trying to think that we &apos;re trying to think of ourselves .
We &apos;ve got to get rid of the world , and we &apos;ve got to have the world .
They &apos;re going to take away from the drawings , and they &apos;re going to be .
They &apos;re actually going to see , they &apos;re in the rights , and that &apos;s good .

So we &apos;ve been able to get rid of the energy that we &apos;ve got to have a space that we &apos;re going to be able to move into space .
So , we &apos;re actually , we &apos;re beautiful .
There &apos;s another way we &apos;re using a different way .
It &apos;s actually the idea of what &apos;s going to be .
It &apos;s a very different way to do that , and they &apos;re going to be able to do it .

He said , &quot; &quot; You know , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you &apos;re going to be there .
So , they &apos;re going to be able to get rid of it , and they &apos;re not going to be able to do it .
I &apos;d like to do it , and I started with myself .
I think it &apos;s a prediction that &apos;s wrong is that I think it &apos;s an objective reality .
