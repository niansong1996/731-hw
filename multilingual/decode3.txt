It was a summer of 2005 .
They worked a lot of science in the U.S.
I &apos;d love my work , but they needed me a little bit of a chip .
So I &apos;ve gotten up to the end of my friends , Chris Hansen .
Now , Chris doesn &apos;t work more than 30 years in the U.S.
I &apos;m going to give you a thank you &apos;re a little bit scared .
I was able to study a series of questions about science and freedom .
But what I wanted to do is to address these problems more face , in a way that could make a difference .
Now , they &apos;ve been looking for me and asks me , &quot; &quot; All of those issues , what are the five things that you &apos;re going to do ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; It &apos;s about genetic modification , &quot; &quot; in genetic modification , they &apos;re inanimate technologies .
And you &apos;re also gotten also , also , that &apos;s actually the one I &apos;ve been talking about , and I &apos;ve been talking about my very , very good , and I &apos;ve been talking about how I &apos;ve been talking about it .
So , what &apos;s the thing about Los Angeles ?
&quot; &quot; Yeah , that &apos;s the American genes . &quot;
&quot; No . &quot;
&quot; &quot; Here &apos;s telling me that America &apos;s most part of the human body .
You can &apos;t be honest . &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to go to my coma , and I &apos;ll tell you , Chris .
And 20 minutes later , he came up with hundreds .
&quot; Didn &apos;t you ? &quot;
( Laughter ) And it &apos;s a big lawyer , but I didn &apos;t know any of the things that I didn &apos;t know .
I knew something about genetics , but it wasn &apos;t going to be exhausted , but it wasn &apos;t enough for the U.S.
It was clear that there was a lot to learn before that anybody had to demand before .
So first , we had to know exactly what happens when somebody was diagnosed when somebody had had a gene .
They &apos;re in the U.S.
We &apos;re not convinced that they &apos;re taking genes in the body . &quot; &quot; And it &apos;s true , but it &apos;s the problem that &apos;s incredible , it &apos;s a source to have genes for us .
And Moore &apos;s Law has no special property in particular , but it &apos;s all a gene .
And what does this mean ?
Oh , you can &apos;t ask the genes to a physician , and ask your physician , to give them a test , to see if they &apos;re having a lot of overreaction .
It also means that the Greeks have the master &apos;s law , and it &apos;s a gene that &apos;s involved in terms of research or clinical trials .
Imagine that these doctrines , the private companies , they &apos;re in private companies , they &apos;re a human right , and they &apos;re a human right .
We &apos;ve got one in the first one , a 10-year-old , a little bit of a child-generated syndrome , a child who doesn &apos;t , if you don &apos;t , it &apos;s a little bit scary .
The company , they &apos;re just two genes associated with this disease to create a testable language .
But then he &apos;d been kidnapped , and she never broke it .
But it &apos;s a company that &apos;s going to lead them to the U.S.
Two years , we can &apos;t make a test .
During that time , it &apos;s been killed by a lot of people who died .
They weren &apos;t a problem with DDT .
Would someone want to have some of you in front of you ?
You know , they &apos;ve been able to take evidence of a long-term view of what &apos;s going on there , and there &apos;s a series of things that aren &apos;t taking place .
They can &apos;t make products , they &apos;re not the air , the air , they &apos;re , they &apos;re also the key ingredients .
They don &apos;t have the laws of nature , they &apos;re the laws of the world , and it &apos;s a liter of vacancy .
They &apos;re very careful , and they &apos;re going to be very close to everyone .
We &apos;ve been able to understand the more fundamental understanding of our own , but it &apos;s a natural nature of nature , it &apos;s possible that it &apos;s probably what &apos;s going on in our bodies or the ground .
We traveled the best , we traveled to a country to speak differently with different computers , vocational training , lawyers , lawyers , pigs .
Most of the majority we &apos;ve been talking about is a reason for a political universe , and it &apos;s less in theory , where we &apos;re in the heart .
They &apos;re all thinking they &apos;re hoping to come up with our own , and they &apos;ve been doing so many of them .
But why ?
It turns out that they &apos;ve gotten over the 15th office , and it &apos;s about 20 years .
There were thousands of thousands of American genes .
I was trying to cite in the world around this practice , and they &apos;re taking practice to the practice , and they &apos;re looking for DDT last year , the year 2000 year .
Briefly , they don &apos;t want to be willing to make these bills .
But , I don &apos;t know they &apos;re afraid , and they &apos;re actually , &quot; &quot; They &apos;re a reason , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to have some of it . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Hey , I &apos;ve gotten most of the Legos for themselves .
So we started to look at the cause .
And they &apos;re concerned about the Islamists of the U.S.
They weren &apos;t interested in these kinds of things , and we thought , we thought , what caused us to do more .
It &apos;s been done by science , it &apos;s a doctor and the rights of patients .
So we decided to open up anything like , as you &apos;ve probably mentioned , but there &apos;s no reason for the human rights .
You know , we &apos;ve been asking them to be a pro-propriate agreement , and what we &apos;ve been able to do , and what we &apos;ve been able to do , and what we &apos;re trying to do is identify how they &apos;re taking those in the U.S.
We &apos;ve overestimated that the FBI informant was an FBI informant , a company within Copenhagen .
They &apos;ve been created by three genes , they &apos;re taking two genes , they &apos;re very enthusiastic .
The women within certainties in these genes are more likely to be diagnosed with cancer , cancer .
It &apos;s one of those projections on the U.S.
He didn &apos;t have a lot of the labs going to allow us to address the fudge test .
They didn &apos;t have lots of money for their test .
They &apos;re willing to share their clinical trials with an international community .
And it &apos;s been achieved for a long time , and they &apos;ve been able to focus on their tests for the kind of test that they &apos;ve been identified by the participants that they &apos;ve been identified by a team in France .
It &apos;s been a long period for years , it &apos;s a year , and it &apos;s been taken for years , and it &apos;s been taken for years , and it &apos;s been taken for years , and they &apos;ve been able to read a better answer , and it &apos;s clear : a few other things that you should be positive .
That &apos;s Alicia .
Management Merkel , and I &apos;ve been incarcerated , and it &apos;s about 40 years , and it didn &apos;t have the tests .
The testing test .
The family gave me lessons .
But it &apos;s probably not the present in the family , so the other people who have no family needed to make the test .
But two years later , Muriel Cooper was diagnosed with cancer .
And they &apos;ve been fascinated by a half-year-old , and they &apos;ve been diagnosed with 12 percent of the people who have been able to get someone else &apos;s reaction .
And if you wanted to earn the right answer , Jean Merkel would have a test , and preventive cancer .
They &apos;re going to be able to do this problem .
It &apos;s a four researchers , and they &apos;re actually able to earn more than 150,000 physicians , or they &apos;re actually able to earn a better testing test , or they &apos;re asking the second questions that you don &apos;t have to give , for example , for the few Americans .
One of the challenges that we face , we &apos;ve been waiting for this situation , it &apos;s a way to think about science .
It wasn &apos;t a design , and we had to describe a couple of principles of basic principles of simple principles : What is a gene ? What is a gene ?
How does DNA , and why doesn &apos;t it ?
We traveled hundreds of thousands of thousands and hours and experts , trying to explain how these ideas are simply the concepts of life .
And at the end , we &apos;ve been waiting for the kind of analogies that they are .
So it &apos;s like champagne for a mountain or the river .
They &apos;re going to have the process to get out of it , but you can &apos;t get your own destiny .
They &apos;re actually trying to make the work that they &apos;re coming in the mountain ; they can &apos;t get it .
And actually , you can &apos;t see the things that he was in the mountain , for example , for example , for example , because you couldn &apos;t get it , because they stayed there .
In the year , we were exhausted to present .
Here &apos;s the head of the head of the New York City of New York , and it &apos;s in the middle of New York , and it &apos;s rainy .
In June 2010 , you &apos;re going to be able to see that they &apos;re addicted : 15,000 pages : 150,000 reports for us .
When we listen to his opinions , it &apos;s adaptable to us that it &apos;s based on the science of science .
I mean , we &apos;re pretty good , but it &apos;s not that good .
How is it going to be able to develop something that is so deep that it &apos;s so deep ?
We don &apos;t want to imagine how it &apos;s possible .
So it turned out that they didn &apos;t take care of it , it wasn &apos;t just a lawyer — it was a scientist .
And it wasn &apos;t just a scientist — I was a PhD in biology .
( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; Hey !
And then he appealed to the right-hand side of the brain .
And here &apos;s some interesting things .
First of all , in this country , the government of the United States is moving .
In the grandstand , the government was able to get a full-blown mission .
But the government was actually asked for the first time they &apos;ve been talking about the full potential decisions of the bureaucracy , and what they &apos;re going to do , and what they didn &apos;t have , and what they didn &apos;t mean , they weren &apos;t taking it .
It was very important , and it &apos;s absolutely unfair .
They &apos;re taking a lot of those , and they &apos;re taking care of the U.S. , and it &apos;s very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very ,
So that &apos;s the same events in the auditorium , we &apos;ve gone to lose .
And it was .
It &apos;s smaller or less .
The decision was to 2 cents .
But the two things that we &apos;ve voted for us , and they &apos;ve been able to do something completely different .
The first , the judges , they made their own , and the new theory , its fragility .
( Laughter )
It wasn &apos;t convinced that he wasn &apos;t convinced that he had no sense .
Another judge , they said , &quot; &quot; Well , they said , &quot; &quot; Hey , he said , &quot; &quot; How did we have them ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And they said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve been interested in the &apos; 90s . &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot;
But , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to call it &quot; &quot; Science &quot; &quot; process .
You &apos;re going to ask you a question that they &apos;ve gotten to the sales that they &apos;re responding to .
So , these questions are actually a little bit trickier . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) But they &apos;re often taking a lot of contact with a lot of people .
We didn &apos;t do whatever it was asking the bigger question more than they did .
In the words of words , they &apos;re radically defined by human genes ?
When I &apos;m an optimist , I &apos;m wondering what those words , I think , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know .
I thought , &quot; &quot; Oh , &quot; &quot; I think , &quot; &quot; Oh , that &apos;s what happens ? &quot; &quot; No .
I mean , they &apos;re going to have the same reaction that you &apos;ve talked about . &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve got seven years &quot; &quot; seven . &quot; &quot; And that &apos;s what I was saying ?
They &apos;re only entering a one percent of the treatments that we &apos;re doing , and they &apos;re going to be able to listen .
He &apos;s very very interested , and they &apos;ve been very interested in the outside , people who &apos;s ever gotten together , and they &apos;ve got 2 2 , they &apos;re 30 to 30 .
They &apos;ve been incarcerated by the breast cancer , they &apos;re actually entering against the bill .
Now , Chris and I &apos;ve been talking about the moments , the moments before he lived , he was able to choose the most important situation in her career .
I was a lot more sensitive to him .
( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause )
You know , they &apos;ve been asked to they &quot; &quot; They &quot; &quot; — they &apos;re in the rooms , and they &apos;ve been working in the rooms , and they &apos;re each of the things that I &apos;ve been trying to do .
I was a forger .
Now , Chris comes out of the way .
But I &apos;ve been able to go to the island , and they &apos;ve been able to have a very , very , very strongly , very , very strongly , very similar way of thinking about how we &apos;ve been working on our own last seven years .
Ign Turing is actually removing the DNA from the DNA of a drug dealer .
The Royal Academy of Randy doesn &apos;t want to make a smile of a tree .
And it was my very , very , very , ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) When we got rid of it , we &apos;ve got a lot of trust , but they &apos;re very trusted , but they can be able to differentiate the outcome : nine to nine .
&quot; &quot; Well , it &apos;s an animal , &quot; &quot; and it &apos;s a self-organizing diet , and it &apos;s not just that it &apos;s likely to be touched .
And you didn &apos;t invent anything else . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And that &apos;s what they &apos;ve been able to do , and they &apos;re the ones that they started to transfer the test to the testing of genes .
Some of them were announcing the testing test .
Some of you have been FDA approved by a more famous testament to what you &apos;ve heard .
But the day they &apos;ve been achieved by the worst decisions .
It &apos;s been translated into a practice that they &apos;re going to get the genes in the United States .
It &apos;s cleared in the middle of the fact that the media and the research series .
And he helped the patient &apos;s patients &apos; typewriters , and they &apos;ve been able to support the tests that they needed .
You &apos;re in the weekend after weeks , and they &apos;re going to have the decisions , I &apos;ve got a little sticker on the box .
It &apos;s been taken by TEDGlobal , a teacher in the University of England , and one of the first people I &apos;ve been talking about .
( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And the smiles are a lot of good news .
It &apos;s the one that I &apos;ve been working on with the risks to address those risks that we were able to do the right thing .
The process of the process was almost eight years ago , and at the end , with lots of reflections , and they weren &apos;t even aware of it .
Well , I wanted to arrest , but the communities that we &apos;re doing , and the things that we &apos;ve created , what they &apos;re in .
Thank you .
( Applause )
So let me show you , I &apos;m going to show you a penguin from eight projects , and within my projects , I think I &apos;ve been cataloguing a lot of documents that I &apos;m talking about .
We &apos;re talking about the U.S.
It &apos;s my attempt to ask for them almost as they &apos;re actually putting in his body , and it turns out the lights , the lights , they &apos;re going to take a picture of the water , or they &apos;re going to take a hug .
When I grew up , it was worse , and I started to see how a way to control .
Now , of course , it &apos;s never , because it &apos;s never very poor , it &apos;s a very appealing to the family .
What I &apos;ve been able to do , and I &apos;ve been touching my own mobile phone use .
He &apos;s a dentist , and he &apos;s going to feel that he &apos;s a number of people that he &apos;d enjoyed .
But the answers for my great answer , I &apos;ve been asking the &quot; &quot; The &quot; &quot; The &quot; &quot; The &quot; &quot; The &quot; &quot; The &quot; &quot; The &quot; &quot; The &quot; &quot; The &quot; &quot; The &quot; &quot; &#93; &quot; &quot; It &apos;s
It &apos;s exactly the way I &apos;ve been working on a mobile phone for a person .
The problem is , when I got home , I went to college , and I started to look at less repairability .
So that &apos;s a machine that I &apos;ve ever done , and I &apos;ve invented the golden machine with what you could think of yourself , and they &apos;re also tracking the world &apos;s offices .
What I had to do with a paper , I &apos;m going to be able to play the paper , write the email file or a paper .
It &apos;s a device that &apos;s been asked by a person who &apos;s responding to another person &apos;s email .
Here you can see a lot of traits that we &apos;ve been able to understand . It &apos;s all mechanical , and it becomes digital .
So my privilege was just with a mechanical framework .
And , in the course , it has to be great , and it &apos;s got to have a creative psychotherapism , so I love my greatest .
The next project is sensitive to the &quot; &quot; Print &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; We &apos;re &quot; &quot; — we wanted to work within each of these creatures , and they &apos;re very strange creatures and they &apos;re comfortable .
This works . We have these scores here on the wall , and we have these little creatures that we &apos;re comfortable with .
We &apos;re looking at the silence , the diversity .
And if there &apos;s more silence , I &apos;ve been blessed .
And they &apos;re on the ground , they &apos;re going to reject again .
So , we have these scores on three walls of a room .
And we &apos;ve made 500 to 500 others .
And that &apos;s how it works .
This is a series of videos .
When there &apos;s silence , there &apos;s figs coming out of it .
It &apos;s likely , and they &apos;re also wondering whether they &apos;re individual creatures .
And they &apos;re immune to them , and they &apos;re all the time .
They don &apos;t respond to them .
You &apos;re going to take a train in a moment that doesn &apos;t respond .
( Laughter ) But the answer is , well , they &apos;re in the first angle .
( Laughter ) It &apos;s very difficult to work for the most difficult way to make it .
Each person has his own experience , they &apos;re changed , they &apos;re feelings , etc .
This is a very short-time prototype .
Of course , it was better than that .
We knew that people responded to people , but we knew that people were very fragmented and quite often taking care of them .
This is a video called &quot; &quot; The &quot; &quot; — &quot; &quot; and we &apos;ve been very interested in the idea of playing with emotions .
How would it be possible ?
We worked away with a piece of surveillance , and we asked them to look at people in the room , and they &apos;re going to follow these people in the room , and it &apos;s going to take a person on top of it .
I &apos;m going to show you a very short journey .
In the right , you can see my friends , and they &apos;re in fact , it &apos;s in space .
And on the left , you see the marker where the camera does it .
They want to walk in the fourth .
You can see how the camera does .
It &apos;s a short video , which we still don &apos;t know , but we don &apos;t want to overcome it , but it &apos;s getting closer .
So we did it in a room where there was a camera in the room , and we had a computer on every wall .
And the second people lived in the room , and it &apos;s a difference : a person was constantly aware of the invisible where they moved into the room .
It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; The Sun &quot; &quot; — it &apos;s almost like a paper-based paper , and it &apos;s a little bit like having a child &apos;s eye of oil or oil .
In front of this object , it seemed to be very strong and very strong and and very , very , very popular .
People would walk around the room , and it couldn &apos;t be sure that I couldn &apos;t think it was a bit deep .
But it &apos;s very close to me , and it &apos;s going to start taking off the walls of the wall .
They &apos;re always going to be able to do it forever .
( Laughter ) That &apos;s a picture of a man in the face of a man .
It &apos;s so heavy , it seems so that it &apos;s coming in your chest , and it seems that it &apos;s moving and it &apos;s growing almost almost like a tree .
What it &apos;s moving around in your head like this , as I &apos;ve been hearing , I &apos;ve been able to touch myself in a very tactile movement .
It &apos;s a bit like this .
Because it &apos;s not touched there , and it &apos;s very , very , very , very , very , very quickly , it &apos;s going to turn into space .
And there &apos;s no wires .
Here &apos;s an example of an example , when people walked in the room , it &apos;s a picture .
And it &apos;s very , very short , and it &apos;s very scary , it &apos;s a speed , and it looks like it &apos;s falling .
It &apos;s a important moment , because we &apos;ve been fascinated by a self-organizing style , and it &apos;s going to be changing .
It doesn &apos;t necessarily have to do because he &apos;s the same to wake up .
This worked very hard for us , like most of our employees , for most years to get a mechanical , a mechanical , a balance , a perfect dynamic .
We &apos;ve been very important for the right time to get that balance , and they don &apos;t fall out , and they don &apos;t fall out , they don &apos;t fit it , and it &apos;s the effect , it &apos;s the effect to go .
I &apos;m going to show you a little bit faster where we do a game . It &apos;s a lot faster .
That &apos;s my buddy . Let &apos;s go .
Now , that &apos;s how nervous it is .
But they don &apos;t need to do , because they &apos;re going to go to the same .
Here &apos;s a very , very supportive work that we &apos;ve worked with , and it &apos;s been working with thousands of thousands of acres of snakes , what they did .
And it &apos;s the baseline of the night sky .
We &apos;ve been able to put this together in a way that they &apos;re moving into the skin .
It was so cold , and it &apos;s been so cold , and it &apos;s likely , as opposed to the universe , as you &apos;re most familiar with your skin , that &apos;s very exciting .
So the idea was to look at a way to look at a way of the skin , and they couldn &apos;t be a black hole in space , like you &apos;d look at the sky in the sky .
This is a very powerful journey , but you &apos;re actually trying to put yourself in the room , if you &apos;re trying to translate it into a permanent amount of weight , and it &apos;s about two and four times smaller .
It &apos;s physically balanced , and it &apos;s in the way that they &apos;re actually moving away , like they &apos;re actually trying to hide a secret for their secrets , or something like this .
We work with a lot of technology , but it really doesn &apos;t really care , because it &apos;s a lot of women in our work for years .
But we &apos;re using the particularly interested in the way that helps us express the feelings and patterns in these creatures .
When they &apos;re in it , it &apos;s almost impossible to tell you how they &apos;re in the way that these creatures want to be aware , what they want to take , and how they want to move .
Thank you .
( Applause )
Now , I &apos;m going to start with you , and you &apos;re going to be able to think of a usefulness of technology and all of you , and ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ends ) Now , it &apos;s very clear that you &apos;re comfortable with two minutes .
But I &apos;m sorry to ask you now now that you &apos;re going to zoom in your body and what you &apos;re doing with it .
Now , how many of you are in some ways ?
It &apos;s unctuous , and they &apos;re also , they &apos;re also , they &apos;re in the latest .
Sometimes we can .
Sometimes you &apos;re going to go . ( Laughter ) So let me tell you what I see .
Let &apos;s take care of what you do right now .
We &apos;re going to go back to this in a moment , and I &apos;m hoping you &apos;ve learned that it &apos;s a little bit that you can &apos;t take care of the developing world .
Okay , we &apos;re very interested in language language , and we &apos;re interested in the language of other languages .
You know , it &apos;s one , a smile , a smile , a little bit closer , a little bit of your eyes or your eyes or something like you &apos;re having your hands .
Tourist : Here &apos;s where they &apos;re coming to the top 10 .
Here &apos;s the police , and it &apos;s very fortunate , and it &apos;s going to give you a hand to the United States .
Thank you . ( Applause )
It &apos;s the same , and they &apos;re in the New York Times .
So when we think about the English language , we &apos;re not likely to call it the word &quot; &quot; Jeopardy &quot; &quot; — we &apos;re talking about the language , therefore it &apos;s very powerful .
When we talk about communication , we think .
What do I communicate ?
What do you teach me ?
There &apos;s a reason for why it &apos;s going to produce this approach .
We &apos;re a lot of time , and we &apos;re a lot of time from other people or other people .
We &apos;ve started the judgments and the brain .
These judgments can be influenced by the importance of life as they &apos;re taking care of how we trust or or they &apos;re asking the letter .
You see , in the next 30 years , they &apos;re actually putting their own preferences about their pleasures about themselves , and they &apos;re comfortable with your physician , and I &apos;ve been interested in the doctor &apos;s office .
So you don &apos;t have a doctor &apos;s hand , and it wasn &apos;t a doctor or a physician , and it wasn &apos;t enough , but if you &apos;re a person , it &apos;s kind of like a genius .
I &apos;ve been incarcerated for 70 percent of the people in the world , and they &apos;ve been interested in the digital , and they &apos;re very interested in using what they &apos;re used in terms of the lines that they can use more value .
If you don &apos;t have a bad idea , right ?
The language isn &apos;t talking about how we judge others as opposed to other others , as opposed to us and what they are .
But we tend to remember another thing that influences our language isn &apos;t a word , what we &apos;re doing .
We &apos;re willing to connect with our languages , our languages , our ideas , our ideas , they &apos;re suffering .
Isn &apos;t that language I &apos;m not talking about ?
They &apos;re social , and I &apos;m involved in the social media , and they &apos;re in a school , so that &apos;s what I &apos;ve been interested in .
They &apos;ve been interested in musical expressions , and it &apos;s not the same as they &apos;re taking .
What are the expressions of the artistic power and what ?
Okay , that &apos;s how it works .
In the animal kingdom , the animals have to look at the transformation , and they &apos;re not going to be able to see what happens .
It &apos;s too big to do that , I &apos;ve been able to make space .
It &apos;s got to open .
And that &apos;s how it works .
It doesn &apos;t just have been very clear .
We &apos;re human beings . ( Laughter ) That &apos;s the same , so they have the power of changing and also when they feel powerful at the time .
It &apos;s particularly interesting especially interesting , because they &apos;re in ancient and a few other ways that these are musical expressions .
Here &apos;s a musical expression , which is how proudly I &apos;ve been talking about , and I &apos;ve been talking about it , and I &apos;ve been talking about myself , and I &apos;ve been talking about myself , and I &apos;ve been talking about myself , and I &apos;ve been talking about myself , and I &apos;
But what you &apos;re wondering is that there &apos;s a lot of people who tell us that the people who are dying in the way that they &apos;re blind , they &apos;re welcomed by themselves , they &apos;re the same , they &apos;re going to win within the physical competition .
So when they &apos;re on the line , and they don &apos;t win , they don &apos;t care anybody else .
Okay .
They &apos;re scared , and they &apos;re missing a remote .
What do we do when we &apos;re comfortable ?
We start the opposite .
We &apos;re hungry . It &apos;s going to happen .
We &apos;re smaller .
We don &apos;t want to paste within that we &apos;re in touch .
And the same animals as human beings do .
And that &apos;s what happens when we &apos;re forced to adapt .
What we &apos;re hoping to do when it &apos;s the power of power , it &apos;s a language that &apos;s not another language .
So if somebody &apos;s very powerful , we tend to make more small , and we don &apos;t .
We start the opposite .
Can I see this behavior in class , what do I say ?
I &apos;ve gotten the students who have been diagnosed with the language of languages .
There are people who &apos;ve been incarcerated , they &apos;re in the same way before they &apos;re starting to start .
When you don &apos;t , they tend to expand .
They &apos;re going to give you a hand .
Then there are other people who &apos;s coming up , and they &apos;re moving .
It &apos;s in your faces , they &apos;re in the body , and they &apos;re going to have heterosexuals , and they do , and they do .
Here &apos;s two things happening .
You don &apos;t surprise me .
It &apos;s going to have to do with sex .
Women are more likely to do that for men .
Women &apos;s curiosity are always going to be less powerful than men , so that &apos;s not surprising .
But the other thing that I &apos;m looking at is that it seems to be based on contemporary students within the population level .
And that &apos;s very important that &apos;s very important in the form of self-organizing , because it &apos;s coming to the top of the third .
You &apos;re going to run a fight with a liberation without sex .
Here &apos;s women , and then they &apos;re looking at these differences in the boxes , which seems to be a part of the field .
So I started asking me , &quot; &quot; If there are people who &apos;s in that context , &quot; &quot; and that &apos;s what you &apos;re going to do .
Would it be possible to do something that &apos;s going to be anything else ?
I &apos;ve been collaborating in Baltimore , and I shouldn &apos;t know , and we should know if you can imagine it .
It &apos;s just that it &apos;s just a moment , and it &apos;s just a chance to experience in your behavior that you can &apos;t feel more powerful than you ?
We know that language doesn &apos;t matter what other people don &apos;t think , and thinking , there are many tests .
But the question was : &quot; &quot; Why doesn &apos;t that compassion doesn &apos;t make sense , &quot; &quot; and the language isn &apos;t a word , and we think we &apos;re thinking the same .
There &apos;s evidence for evidence .
For instance , when we &apos;re happy , but it &apos;s also when we &apos;re hoping , but when we &apos;re wondering , well , if you &apos;re comfortable with teeth , what does it feel ?
It works on two sides .
When the power process , it also works on the two sides .
When you &apos;re so powerful , but it &apos;s also possible when we think of it as powerful , and it &apos;s probably more than we feel powerful .
Well , the second question was , well , we know that our bodies , but it &apos;s also true , but it &apos;s also what the body can do ?
And when I say , well , in the powerful case , what I &apos;m talking about ?
I &apos;m talking about the ideas of the thoughts , and they &apos;re designed by thoughts , and in my case , I &apos;m talking about hormones , I &apos;m talking about hormones .
How is it that it &apos;s the key to talking about what they are ?
People tend to be shocking , and it &apos;s shocking , more satisfied and healthier , more optimistic .
They &apos;re feeling that they &apos;re going to earn the same game games .
It also tends to be considered a little bit more .
There are many differences .
There &apos;s a difference with the difference between the powerful , and they &apos;re not .
They &apos;ve been able to see the difference in two key hormones , they &apos;re the ones that &apos;s actually the hormones , and the colors , the colors , they &apos;re a hormone hormone .
They &apos;re taking a lot of pressure in the middle-to-day , and they &apos;re taking high levels of magnitude , and they &apos;re taking risks to the ground .
What does that mean ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And the power I &apos;ve talked about is the only way I &apos;ve talked about it , because I had to see what was happening .
But the power of power has also to do with our stress response .
We &apos;re going to be a maker , with a lot , with a lot of people , but they &apos;re comfortable .
Right ?
We &apos;re going to be a person who &apos;s illiterate , and they &apos;re not very sensitive , but a person is lost .
You know , if somebody has to take a piece of action , let &apos;s take a paper , take a paper , take a paper out of a few days , and it &apos;s also a lot of time , and that &apos;s a lot of colorful .
We &apos;ve got to know that they may be able to connect , and they &apos;re less skilled , and it also is also what drives itself .
So , what happens when it takes a piece of paper ? It &apos;s that it does it , if you &apos;re a chimpanzee , how do you do that ?
We &apos;d say , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re just three minutes , and you &apos;re both like , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to make you feel more powerful . &quot; &quot; And that &apos;s what we did .
Now , they &apos;re in a very small world , because I &apos;m going to show you , for two minutes , I &apos;m just going to show you three minutes , and I &apos;m just going to show five of those five , but they &apos;re just two .
This is a one .
Here &apos;s more than a couple more than a couple more more than a couple more more than a couple more more than a couple more more than a couple more more than a couple more more than a couple more more than a couple more more than a couple more more than a couple more more than a couple more more than a couple more more than a couple more more than a couple more more than a couple more more than a couple more more than a couple more more than a few more
It &apos;s the media press .
Here we have one more .
You can go to your feet , you &apos;re sitting there .
Here &apos;s what they do .
Now it &apos;s gotten up . It &apos;s smaller .
It &apos;s very hot .
When they &apos;re playing all these damages , they &apos;re real .
This is what happens .
He &apos;s in a part , and you tell me three minutes , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re going to do that . &quot; &quot; He &apos;s not just seeing the photos .
We don &apos;t want to translate them without power .
We want to make the power .
That &apos;s two minutes .
And then we asked them , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re a powerful fan ? &quot; &quot; And then we &apos;re going to give you a chance to go .
That &apos;s everywhere . It &apos;s all the time .
So that &apos;s what we found .
He &apos;s sent to the risk to the risk , and we find that when they &apos;re in a position of power , they &apos;re actually forced to be able to stay in the middle .
When they &apos;re underwater , it &apos;s only 60 percent . It &apos;s a very significant value .
Let &apos;s look at what we find .
It &apos;s a normal understanding of their normal conditions , and they &apos;re going to be able to be able to become a positive experience of an increase in 20 or 20 , and they &apos;re they &apos;ve experienced 10 percent .
Time again , two minutes , and it &apos;s changed .
Now the results with color .
The most powerful experiences of the age of 79 percent , they &apos;re more likely to be connected to 15 percent .
Just only two , they &apos;ve got changes that you &apos;ve got to do with yourself , whether you &apos;re willing to do it , if you &apos;re willing to save , or whether they &apos;re comfortable with stress , it &apos;s also breaking into the needle .
We all know that feeling , right ?
If it doesn &apos;t make sense , the language doesn &apos;t just see us in the same way , not just any other , but it &apos;s the same .
The body can change it .
The next question , of course , is that a movement of ability can change in a life-changing environment .
This is in the lab , it &apos;s just two minutes .
Where do you really do this ?
That &apos;s what we care about .
We think that &apos;s the situation where you need to be in the situation that you &apos;ve got to be in the way that they &apos;re in social media .
You &apos;ve been asking yourself what they &apos;ve been doing .
For the teenagers , they &apos;re in the morning .
So some people are talking about the schools .
It could be a business or a talk , or a talk like this , or to make a job .
We listened to one of the most people who are choosing , because it &apos;s a lot of people who &apos;ve done it .
So we analyzed the results , and that &apos;s what you &apos;re going to do when you &apos;re going to have a schedule , right ?
( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) We &apos;ve been talking about it : God , thank God , not because we should .
For many reasons , no , no .
Again , it &apos;s not going to talk to other people .
It &apos;s about to talk about the same .
What do you want to go before ? He &apos;s doing this .
You &apos;re sitting . You look at your wallet or your Android , you don &apos;t . Nobody .
You &apos;re a little fan , you &apos;re in a small , when you want to go on this , maybe it &apos;s in the place , &quot; &quot; Okay . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; Okay . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; Okay ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So , you
That &apos;s what we want ?
We associate people in the lab , and they &apos;re taking a high-resolution amount of pressure , and they &apos;re going to be able to make some of the things that they &apos;re dealing with .
It &apos;s five minutes . It &apos;s a film .
They &apos;re also judges , and they &apos;re taking places to say that they don &apos;t want to be able to read the Englishs .
Imagine you &apos;re going to have a target .
For five minutes , there &apos;s nothing worse than you want .
People applaud this .
It &apos;s a USB key to be called &quot; &quot; The &quot; &quot; — &quot; &quot; You &apos;re in the &quot; &quot; social . &quot; &quot; And that &apos;s the magic .
That &apos;s what we &apos;re going to do , because we should see what they were .
We &apos;ve gotta look at the podium , four to four .
They don &apos;t know . They don &apos;t .
They don &apos;t have the idea that they &apos;re going on every person , they said , &quot; &quot; They said , &quot; &quot; They &apos;re going to run these people &apos;s . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; They &apos;re all the power of power .
&quot; &quot; We don &apos;t want to resist . &quot;
We &apos;ve got a lot more choices . &quot; &quot; What was it ?
It &apos;s not about the content content .
It &apos;s the shape of what they &apos;ve been doing .
Because we &apos;ve been able to connect with those relatives quickly , and they &apos;re going to lock yourself up .
Doesn &apos;t you ? What rating agencies have you ?
These things don &apos;t affect . It &apos;s affecting .
This is a classroom .
Each person touches the same .
They are .
They &apos;re doing ideas , because they &apos;re not .
So that &apos;s what defined or causing it .
When we talk about our bodies , they change our behaviors , and they can change our way to be .
I &apos;m saying , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve got to do that .
I don &apos;t .
I don &apos;t want to get there and feeling a punishment .
I don &apos;t want to go away .
I don &apos;t want to get there for feelings that I don &apos;t want to be there .
It &apos;s very important to me , because I want to tell you a little story about a little bit about getting rid of it , and it &apos;s kind of like not to be there .
When I was in the last year , I had a terrible car accident .
I &apos;ve gotten out of it , and I &apos;ve got a series of epiphanies .
I &apos;ve got a car .
I started working on the street injury in college , and they said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve been told myself , &quot; &quot; They &apos;re dying twice . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) It was very clear .
They &apos;ve been my favorite , because they &apos;re actually seeded as well .
So I &apos;ve been talking about college and you &apos;ve gotten back .
They said , &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t wait .
You know that you can &apos;t do it , and you &apos;re smart , and they &apos;re smart , and they &apos;re smart , and they &apos;ve been asked , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m smart , &quot; &quot; and it &apos;s smart , that &apos;s the thing that &apos;s more elegant , you can also make sense .
He kept me quiet .
And I worked , and I worked , and I &apos;ve been lucky , and I &apos;ve been lucky , and I &apos;ve been lucky , I work .
I graduated from college .
I &apos;m four years old , I &apos;ve been able to accept , and they &apos;re supposed to accept me , and they &apos;re on the podium , and I &apos;ve loved it , and I &apos;ve loved how to be there .
The night before they &apos;re on the weekend , they &apos;re going to be one of those others .
That &apos;s the case .
I had been scared by the next day and I said , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re going to let me go . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; No , I &apos;m going to take anything , because I &apos;m going to go out .
You &apos;re standing up , and that &apos;s what you &apos;re going to do .
You &apos;re going to do all the things that you &apos;re going to do .
You &apos;re still going to do it , and I &apos;m sure , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not even going to have a stung , &quot; &quot; and I &apos;ve been able to make a USB key , until I &apos;m going to tell you about what &apos;s going on .
I &apos;m going to come up here . &quot; &quot; And that &apos;s what I &apos;m doing .
A few years old , I don &apos;t know , but I don &apos;t think about it , but I don &apos;t think so many time , but a lot of time , I &apos;ve got a feeling that you don &apos;t want to be there .
I &apos;ve been opened up in the U.K. , which you &apos;re going to be in the morning , you &apos;re going to bets , or you &apos;re going to meet . &quot; &quot; I came up with myself . I didn &apos;t know before .
It &apos;s been refuted . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to be here .
That &apos;s my time .
Because they were two things .
The first thing I &apos;ve seen is , &quot; &quot; Oh , I &apos;m not .
I don &apos;t care about humor , but I &apos;m not in my place .
The second thing is , obviously , you should be here .
Okay , so we can imagine it , and it can do it .
So they said , &quot; &quot; Yes , of course . I know you should be here . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Yeah .
( Applause ) And you &apos;re going to go across the world &apos;s best place , and I don &apos;t know what I &apos;m going to do , and I don &apos;t know what they &apos;re doing , and I don &apos;t know if it &apos;s possible .
It can change .
Now , I want to tell you that there &apos;s no reason to do it .
So there &apos;s something we can do to it .
There &apos;s something that &apos;s enough enough to make it .
The last thing I &apos;m going to talk about is that .
They &apos;re constantly making big things .
They &apos;re just two minutes .
You &apos;re going to admire the next day where they &apos;re going to meet for two minutes , trying to expose this , in the middle of the hotel , in the middle of the door .
That &apos;s what you have to do .
It &apos;s a brain that &apos;s going to allow us to make the brain a better place to do that .
It &apos;s a little bit away .
You don &apos;t know about the situation that &apos;s wrong without knowing how I &apos;ve shown you .
You know , that &apos;s the situation that &apos;s going on with the feelings that I &apos;m going to tell you about what it is .
I want to ask you before , and I want to ask you before a position of power , and I also want to share my experience , because it &apos;s very simple .
It doesn &apos;t adapt to this . ( Laughter ) They &apos;re better for people , because the best you can use it , they &apos;re not , they don &apos;t have technology , it &apos;s a position .
They &apos;re going to be addictive with them because they can do it in private .
They &apos;re just forced their body , serotonin , and two minutes to change their lives .
Thank you .
( Applause )
I mean , I want to talk about the world &apos;s biggest problem .
I &apos;m not going to talk about the Aboriginals and the &quot; &quot; The &quot; &quot; — that &apos;s probably a good choice .
( Laughter ) I &apos;m hungry to tell you , what are the big issues of the world ?
And I &apos;m going to continue , I &apos;m going to be able to make a piece of paper and paper , because I &apos;m going to ask you , because I &apos;m going to ask you how we do it .
So , let &apos;s take a piece of paper and paper .
You know , there &apos;s a lot of problems in the world where there are .
I &apos;m just going to play a few .
There are thousands of millions of people running out there .
Two million people have no access to the water .
Two billion people have been healthy .
Two million people die of AIDS and AIDS .
They &apos;re in the way .
I have two billion people who &apos;ve seen each other &apos;s diagnosis , and they are .
We have lots , lots of hurdles .
In the ideal world , we &apos;ve been able to figure out what we are .
It &apos;s really what we &apos;re dealing with .
And you can &apos;t do it — it &apos;s really what we &apos;re doing , really , really , really , what we &apos;re going to start with , and we &apos;re going to start asking questions , what are we supposed to solve ?
That &apos;s the question I want to ask you .
We should we have been 50 billion to have three billion dollars to take over four years to improve this world , and what should we do ?
So I &apos;ve described the world &apos;s greater world , and they &apos;ve been able to innovate , and they &apos;ve gotten together , and they &apos;re willing , they &apos;re hungry , they &apos;re healthy , and they &apos;re going to take the water , and they &apos;re going to meet .
We think these are very , very few ways , they &apos;re separated in the world .
So what &apos;s the problem going to be asking us , what are you thinking ?
Why should we start with these problems ?
But that &apos;s a question that &apos;s going to be a problem , and it &apos;s actually a problem .
It &apos;s real , and that &apos;s what he &apos;s talking about .
But of course , there &apos;s a problem going to ask people what they &apos;re planning for .
Because we can &apos;t have trouble .
And that &apos;s the biggest problem that we have in the world that we all die .
But we don &apos;t have the technology for what we have ?
So the problem is that they &apos;re actually mastering the problems , without making decision solutions .
And it &apos;s probably because it &apos;s a little bit more complicated .
For example , it &apos;s something that &apos;s going to be something like this .
For instance , in terms of mental illness , it would be the clinics or the mosquitos .
For them , they &apos;re actually a military force of the U.N. , and so we can stay on it .
What you &apos;ve been asking in 30 seconds , and I &apos;m going to get something that is impossible — it &apos;s impossible to describe what you think , ladies and gentlemen .
And here &apos;s also , of course , where the economy goes down , which is the last year , and what we shouldn &apos;t have to do in the first place .
What should it be ?
Please , you &apos;re just talking to you only 30 , and they &apos;re supposed to be prime ministers , and they &apos;re less interested in those decisions that we have to have the biggest problems in the world .
And of course , I mean , I &apos;m just 18 minutes — I &apos;m just 18 minutes to tell you about a significant amount of time in my time , right ?
I want to focus , and to make you think about this process , and that &apos;s what we really did .
And it &apos;s very powerful , and I &apos;m sure we &apos;ve got these arguments , and I &apos;m willing to have those arguments , to think , how do we actually master a reality ?
But then , there &apos;s another question that you &apos;re going to ask for the same , why doesn &apos;t actually have a picture like this before ?
And it &apos;s a reason , that &apos;s the thing that &apos;s measurable .
Nobody wants to do .
Of course , all the organizations want to be higher than one of those .
But they &apos;re also invited to they &apos;ve been able to get bigger .
And there &apos;s many more numbers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The numbers are not a number . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; It &apos;s another number .
It &apos;s been a U.N. , and it &apos;s actually one of the big things we can do in the world , and they &apos;re going to be in the world , and they should .
So we didn &apos;t really have a certainty , and that &apos;s probably how good it &apos;s been so good if we &apos;ve been able to innovate .
So what I &apos;m really suggesting is , it &apos;s a very long period of time , a long time , a situation where they &apos;re exotic .
There are lots , lots of things that we can do there , but we didn &apos;t have the price .
We didn &apos;t have an idea .
Imagine that you walked in a restaurant , but you don &apos;t know what they are .
They know you &apos;re wrong , but you don &apos;t know how much it is .
I could be one of the reasons , I could be able to get 1,000 dollars .
It could be a wise bonus .
We wanted to know these things .
And that &apos;s what we &apos;re trying to do , and we &apos;re trying to make the price of these issues .
And so , in fact , this was the process of the process .
We posted 30 of the best people in the world , three area area .
We have chosen that we were three to three others of the world &apos;s most populous planets .
What can we do ? What are the costs ? What about the right to you ?
The same with diseases .
Three-thirds of what we can do ?
What &apos;s the price ?
What should we do about it ?
And that &apos;s right .
So let &apos;s take some of the best citizens , they &apos;ve taken some of the people who are willing to live in the world , including three of the world &apos;s favorites , they &apos;re looking at what they &apos;re looking at .
We called &quot; &quot; Economic &quot; &quot; economics . &quot; &quot; They &apos;re also the ones who they &apos;ve been able to call them the economy .
And it works very well in Europe , but here &apos;s not that .
And basically , they &apos;ve done what they did .
And then you &apos;re going to be asking , why are you ?
And of course , I &apos;m actually trying to ask you that question — ( Laughter ) — because it &apos;s a very good question .
The point is , of course , if you want to know , it &apos;s the question for malaria .
If you want to know about climate , they &apos;re a moral believer .
But if you want to know about two , you can &apos;t question any of them , because that &apos;s what they do .
That &apos;s what they do .
They &apos;re taking care of them .
They &apos;ve gotten that kind of thing that we should be able to do first , and we need to do that later .
So that &apos;s me , and that &apos;s what I want to share with you .
I mean , you can see on the web , and I &apos;m also talking about what &apos;s going to lead to the day .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And they &apos;ve been asked , they &apos;ve been designed — they &apos;ve been shown where the projects where they &apos;re in charge , and they &apos;re going to give you less than they &apos;re not .
They &apos;ve been designed , they &apos;re good .
And of course , they &apos;re really good at what we should start .
And I &apos;m going to start from the last mode that we can &apos;t get to the best projects .
So these were really bad things .
As you can see , the latest of it is a bit of a burden .
So that &apos;s a lot of people , and that &apos;s probably one of the things that people say that people shouldn &apos;t .
And I want to talk about that , because it &apos;s real curiosity .
Why ?
And I &apos;m also trying to talk about it because it &apos;s probably one of the things that we &apos;re going to do with yourself to describe yourself .
It &apos;s the reason that I &apos;ve been able to make it — I &apos;m going to make something that I &apos;m going to do — that &apos;s not a good job because it &apos;s very fragile .
It &apos;s not that you don &apos;t have to be the global .
It &apos;s not that it &apos;s not a big problem .
But it &apos;s what we can do , and it &apos;s very little , it &apos;s a very remote cost .
They &apos;ve been very basic , and that &apos;s the average , and I &apos;m sure , if all of the people I &apos;m in the world , you would have 150 billion dollars a year .
That &apos;s a significant amount of money .
Two or three times in the developing world that we worked in the Third World .
And to do that very little .
All the computers that you &apos;re going to say is that it &apos;s six years old .
So there &apos;s another kind of pollination that &apos;s going on in the 21st century , which is the 21st century to wait for 21 .
What it &apos;s doing , but not very good .
So the idea is , well , we risk a lot of money doing something right .
And it &apos;s simply the U.S.
We could open the water , healthy , healthy and education , all human beings .
So we should be wondering , what if we want to spend twice as long ?
Is there a half-way issue that &apos;s going on ?
And that &apos;s where it changes in a wrong project .
It &apos;s not that we &apos;ve gone all the money on the world , we want to do .
No , when we don &apos;t , it &apos;s simply not our first agreement .
So they &apos;re not going to do it , and they &apos;re not only able to do it , because they &apos;re just , it &apos;s simply because it &apos;s the equivalent of the standard financial service providers .
It &apos;s a lot , but it &apos;s very , very , very clear .
Once again , what we &apos;ve been talking about , and we &apos;ve gone , and we started thinking about both sides of the equation .
If you look at the good projects , it &apos;s a lot of good projects .
Once again , the healthier and the water is important , but it also costs lots too .
So I &apos;m not going to tell you , the first time that they &apos;re wondering , they &apos;re wondering when we talk about how they &apos;re interested in the world .
It &apos;s a little bit more indirect than malaria .
malaria is about a couple of millions of people every year .
It would even be an enough to bomb away from the United States for the year , for example .
We &apos;ve got 13 billion dollars to 13 billion dollars on the next four years , and we could reduce the gap between half .
We could prevent the death of 50,000 people , but they &apos;re most important , but it &apos;s important to prevent that there &apos;s thousands of millions of people in the year .
We &apos;ve developed ability to solve lots of other problems that they have to target , and they &apos;re in the long-term , and they &apos;re also willing to shout out .
The third third is that it &apos;s free .
Indeed , we desperately flipped it in the last year , and we &apos;ve been fitted to two-thirds of 2,000 points of a year of a year from the last year , and half a year , they &apos;re half away from the Third World .
Once again , we could really take 200 to 200,000 people or 300 million people in poverty , radically and very fast , and it &apos;s about two and five years .
That &apos;s the third thing that we could do .
The second thing that &apos;s the best thing is that it &apos;s actually going to be inclusion .
We &apos;re not negotiating in general , but without a very economic value , it &apos;s very important , it &apos;s a toxic micro-algae .
Unfortunately , half of the world &apos;s populations have been killed , and I &apos;ve been able to do that .
We &apos;ve developed 40 billion dollars , and we could make a glimpse of this problem .
It &apos;s going to be the second little fun that we could do it .
And the biggest project would be targeted in HIV / AIDS .
Unfortunately , we &apos;ve developed 50 billion dollars in the next eight years , and we could mobilize a million more than six million cases for AIDS .
Again , that &apos;s what you &apos;re planning to do , and that &apos;s what we &apos;re planning to say that we have two different forms of different forms of how to treat HIV / AIDS .
One is treatment , and it &apos;s another one .
Once again , in a human world , we &apos;re going to make two .
But in a world where we don &apos;t have two or three , we shouldn &apos;t do it very , very , very , very few times when you want to question , you should be able to finance the first .
And treatment is much more than that .
So they &apos;re very clear , and that &apos;s what we &apos;re planning to address .
Basically , it &apos;s very clear to reduce the amount of money that we &apos;re going to do well on treatment , and 10 times deeper .
So again , we need to focus exclusively more than treatment , as the first choice .
What it does is that it &apos;s true in reality that it &apos;s true for our priorities .
Would you like to go back to yourself and say , &quot; &quot; Please , what do you do ?
How do you get something like this ?
Well , of course , there &apos;s one thing that &apos;s going on .
A lot of people think it &apos;s very , but it &apos;s a little bit more than that .
We &apos;ve also got to make sure that it &apos;s not another reason , it &apos;s not just a big problem .
But , of course , we don &apos;t really understand .
We have many problems in the world .
And what I &apos;m telling you is that if we &apos;re in trouble , we &apos;re willing to target more .
And so that &apos;s what we can do , so we can do a lot better .
And I think , &quot; &quot; Larry , &quot; &quot; — ( Laughter ) — ( Applause ) ( Applause ) Bruno Giussani : It &apos;s a national class .
One of the things that people are in the age of age , and it &apos;s 100 years old , when we &apos;re talking to most of the people , they &apos;re going to be a lot , they &apos;re going to be a lot more vulnerable .
Even though they &apos;re more likely to do the best , they &apos;re more likely to be able to do that .
They &apos;re going to provide a young person in the developing world , and the 21st century is going to be as rich as we are today .
And it &apos;s probably more than two other four times the richest of what we are .
And of course , if we want more wealth , we want more wealth .
But the problem is , when we talk to save people in Bangladesh , it &apos;s 2133 , we &apos;re not going to talk about the worst pictures .
We &apos;re going to talk about a very high-tech .
And it &apos;s really clear , it &apos;s actually going to make a lot of money , which is a lot of money , that &apos;s a little bit of a few hundred years , is a very high probability .
You can &apos;t help people who are poor , and you &apos;re going to help people in Bangladesh , in Bangladesh , and that &apos;s really useful , and what can we help ?
It &apos;s very , very important . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So I think it &apos;s really , really , really , what we need .
Even if you don &apos;t have any choices , you don &apos;t have a way to see this problem .
Of course , that &apos;s based on relativity because there &apos;s something so good about it .
You know what &apos;s going on , &quot; &quot; He looks great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , that &apos;s cool , right ?
And it &apos;s actually actually actually actually actually trying to take the secrets in the last few years , but I don &apos;t have ants in the last few years trying to read something like this . ( Laughter ) Yeah , it &apos;s not just about a film .
So in a lot of ways , I think they &apos;ve been studying the idea of the arguments , and they &apos;re actually a few of the things they are .
To give you something that &apos;s not enough , it &apos;s simplicity for us to do that .
It &apos;s not going to make a lot of things , but it &apos;s also going to be about places where we can actually make a real greater .
The other objections , I think , that &apos;s important , that &apos;s some important , that &apos;s some of my hands — I &apos;m going to give you a sense of the moral choice .
Of course , we should do it , in a primal world — it &apos;s going to be true .
I think we should do all things , but we don &apos;t .
In the 1970s , the world decided we were able to spend the hundreds of what we &apos;ve done , right now , in the same way that 1970s are developing countries .
However , it &apos;s our way to get out of space .
We don &apos;t realize that we &apos;re in the pathways where we &apos;re all serious problems .
I mean , they &apos;re also saying , but there &apos;s a Syrian war in Iraq .
You know , there &apos;s 100 billion options . &quot; &quot; Because we don &apos;t take 100 million .
I &apos;m sorry .
If you &apos;re going to talk to you about the morning to do that , it &apos;s okay .
But it &apos;s very , very , ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) And it &apos;s probably 100 billion dollars , and it &apos;s going to be the most possible possible way of thinking , right ?
So the real problem is , it &apos;s a new problem , and they &apos;re thinking they &apos;re destined .
I mean , should it really be true ?
You know , when you ask the best of the world , they &apos;re probably wondering , &quot; &quot; You know , &quot; &quot; and they &apos;re probably wondering , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re going to be willing to ask yourself , &quot; &quot; I think , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re probably wondering , &quot; &quot
And they &apos;re not necessary because they &apos;re really cool to look at the static world .
So we &apos;ve come up with 80 / 11 , and it &apos;s all the world to do with the world .
They &apos;re both they &apos;ve been able to read to college , and speak English .
Most of them were , first of them , the parents &apos; time .
They had the same material , but they would have been very interested in the idea of an argument , how they did , and they took their own hands .
And the staggering was that I was very similar — I was diagnosed with PTSD and diseases in the end .
We have many other times .
There were many others in many others and students and lots of different things .
They all have shaped how they were .
And it really , really , really , I think there &apos;s actually a way to start thinking in our positions , and I mean , that &apos;s the most important of the world ?
Of course , in a primal world , it would have been on itself .
But if we don &apos;t do it , can we start to think about where we &apos;re going ?
I &apos;m going to see what they &apos;re looking for as a process .
We &apos;ve done in 2004 , and we &apos;ve got lots more , we &apos;ve got lots of people running a lot better data in 2008 .
It &apos;s the right path to try to innovate the right path to the world . ( Laughter ) But we also start to think about politics .
You know , right now , we don &apos;t know , but you can &apos;t have a very good idea , but you &apos;ve got to say , if we do things that we do , we have others that we don &apos;t do .
If we care about a lot of things , we &apos;re not worried about it .
So I &apos;m hoping that it &apos;s helping us , and they &apos;re helping the best negotiations , and thinking how we work for the world .
Thank you .
There &apos;s a few years old , you know , they &apos;re on the ground .
They &apos;re going to take a friend to take a friend to take a friend of the other side of the city , because that temperature has two dimensions . It &apos;s very cold .
And I was in touch , looking at my pockets , and I knew I had no keys .
In fact , I couldn &apos;t find the window on the window , where they were going .
But they were everywhere .
It wouldn &apos;t take me to the night of my friend &apos;s house , because they had to take out of Europe , and they needed to take the needle and they didn &apos;t .
So , it &apos;s very uncomfortable , and he &apos;s crying , and he &apos;s very cold , and I &apos;ve got a stick , and I &apos;ve got it in the window to cut it .
I &apos;ve been interested in lots of money , but I don &apos;t care about it , but I haven &apos;t gotten a lot more contact in the night .
Okay , I &apos;m going to tell you a little bit about how the brain is .
And it &apos;s kind of titillating , it &apos;s an extraordinary fraction of the world &apos;s edges .
So , the next morning , when I got to sleep , I was able to take a little bit out of the window , and they took off the walls , and they had to have a bunch of thousands and thousands of thousands of thousands of people who had been interested in the world .
And it &apos;s going to go down to the airports that I don &apos;t know .
So I moved to the house and the snow , and I went back to the ice , and I &apos;ve been working on the airport , and I &apos;ve been able to go to the airport , and I &apos;ve got time , but I &apos;m going to give you a little bit of myself , but I &apos;m going to give you another person .
( Laughter ) Oh , in the case , there &apos;s no bad news .
And he said , &quot; &quot; Hey , &quot; &quot; and they said , &quot; &quot; Oh , Jimmy .
And it was something that I had to take out of an email that was written about these years , and that &apos;s also what he also called death .
Have a team of experts trying to determine what &apos;s going on ?
It &apos;s not about death , and it &apos;s likely , and they &apos;re trying to find that they &apos;re trying to determine what they &apos;re trying to do .
What I &apos;m going to talk about today is what we can do today .
Some things are not ; the others are not .
I &apos;m going to start off the floor .
They &apos;re taking places where they &apos;re home for the things that they lose .
Well , this seems so common that it &apos;s very common .
There &apos;s spaces for hundreds of thousands of years to remember very important things , where they &apos;re coming , where they can fish , where they live and they live .
It &apos;s a part of the hippocampus .
It &apos;s a part of the brain .
In fact , somebody didn &apos;t make sense of what he was doing , and he didn &apos;t have a glimpse of his mind that they were able to make sense of what they did .
But it works with things that &apos;s too expensive , and it &apos;s not that things don &apos;t move .
So that &apos;s why there &apos;s actually someone who &apos;s taking a place for keys .
For a magician , I &apos;ve been able to read a specific compassion .
If you &apos;re in a position , and it &apos;s a place where you &apos;re hungry , they &apos;re going to be in your place when they go .
And when we traveled ?
You &apos;re going to be able to get an email from a shot to the cloud .
These are things unseen .
Remember that when we &apos;re eating stress , it &apos;s a brain .
It &apos;s a very , very frustrating , scary thing .
It &apos;s important to recognize that stress isn &apos;t going to be the best I &apos;m going to do with you , and you should .
But they &apos;re not going to be able to do whatever you &apos;ve got a medical decision .
We &apos;re all going to be able to think about this in a moment that we &apos;re going to be able to live in a moment of history .
And that &apos;s what I want to talk about .
We need to be able to do something that we should be able to do .
We &apos;re going to take a physician and say , &quot; &quot; I have the results , and I have the results , and it &apos;s a little bit loud .
You know what &apos;s called the High Line .
And you &apos;re a very good student , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to make a prescription , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s probably the one that &apos;s probably going to meet them . &quot; &quot; And you know what ?
You should be asked for a question .
It &apos;s number number three . And what is the signature ?
It &apos;s number number number number three people who have to give us a drug before you respond .
And you &apos;re thinking , &quot; &quot; You know what ?
The number should be one . &quot; &quot; And my physician should not be something that I don &apos;t want to help .
But medicine doesn &apos;t work .
We still don &apos;t know exactly the same mechanisms .
According to the U.S. , it &apos;s estimate that 90 percent of drugs work between 30 percent .
So what &apos;s going on in the other direction of the prescription ?
How many people have to take credit before they ask ?
So that &apos;s the second results .
I think that &apos;s the data .
And you think .
In this case , it &apos;s a drug that &apos;s in the case of medicine .
And there &apos;s a lot of awful lots of awful lots and lots of awful lots and lots and lots . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) But you think , &quot; &quot; Five percent . I don &apos;t think I &apos;m going .
You &apos;ve got to 15 minutes of choices that you &apos;re going to have .
And I &apos;m not saying , if you want to take it , you don &apos;t want to take it .
It &apos;s just that you should have that conversation with your physician .
You &apos;ve got to have people &apos;s data , and they &apos;re going to have access to the data to talk about it .
And I &apos;m going to talk about this number of numbers , but it &apos;s a number of numbers , but it &apos;s actually a lot of people who &apos;ve been looking at it .
They &apos;re taking away from the nemesis of cancer , and that &apos;s the thing .
Yes , there &apos;s somebody who has recurrent every person who &apos;s helping .
And they &apos;re the ones in this case in 50 percent of patients .
They &apos;re really embarrassed , it &apos;s a coordination .
So , the idea of death to the deaths for the conversation .
The ideal isn &apos;t going to have to make it all the time .
There &apos;s also , there &apos;s also some issues as the quality of life .
They &apos;re things that we should be thinking about now and talking about the family and the other .
Remember , it &apos;s a brain , and it &apos;s one of the things that happened in that moment , and that &apos;s the moment that they &apos;re going to attack a lot of systems .
Evolution , evolution .
Because if you don &apos;t have enough , they &apos;re in these things , because they don &apos;t have a lot of these things , and it doesn &apos;t matter .
Fortunately , there &apos;s one thing that &apos;s called &quot; &quot; The Innocents , &quot; &quot; and they &apos;re stung .
So that &apos;s why we need to train us to think about this kind of situation .
And I think most importantly , it &apos;s to recognize that we all have facial expressions .
We &apos;re going to be wrong .
It &apos;s an idea that you can &apos;t be misinterpreted , and they &apos;re able to reduce the systems that you can &apos;t be able to reduce themselves or to prevent the things that these things live .
He goes to that night . When I &apos;ve been talking about the top-time mark of the door , the door of the house within a house , and it &apos;s easy to remember .
They &apos;re not taking care of them .
Good morning .
Are they going to be ?
Anybody ? No . Okay .
&quot; &quot; Ash , please ? &quot; &quot; And in Arabic .
And I &apos;ve been able to find myself a little bit more interesting .
&quot; &quot; Oh , &quot; &quot; Oh , you see that .
It &apos;s a little bit more likely to have someone who &apos;s talking about me .
It &apos;s only one word that &apos;s a young boy who didn &apos;t have a USB key .
How can you talk about this ?
I always started thinking about it .
And I &apos;ve been doing a lot .
How do we get there ?
That &apos;s the same time .
And yet , it &apos;s all over the world .
We &apos;ve been talking about what we &apos;re talking about , and we &apos;re talking about college and I &apos;m not talking about it .
But there &apos;s another most important difference in the world .
You know , there &apos;s a study that you can &apos;t read to other languages .
And when I was in Arabic , I started writing myself in Arabic , and I started writing myself in Arabic .
It &apos;s all the ideas , your imaginations , the ideas .
And then when he started writing English .
And when we talk about his English , they &apos;re in English .
We can feel that the other one is the same .
In the second place , it &apos;s actually a common language .
This reality has actually changed the way communities are .
They &apos;re in Germany , they &apos;re in the middle of the world .
And that idea hasn &apos;t yet happened , but it didn &apos;t happen to us , but we would like to follow the world .
We need to go back to the industrialized world , and they &apos;re in the world , and the others , and the others , they &apos;re attracting their tongue back to the language , and then they &apos;ve been able to see how they do .
They &apos;re taking care of it .
Because if you don &apos;t have any money , we know that it &apos;s not a commodity .
Nobody believed that it was a car .
They want to be consumers , they &apos;re hungry , they &apos;re hungry .
It &apos;s very specific in the very specific ways .
Language isn &apos;t just one , two or three words or postcards of postcards .
Or you &apos;re in English , and you &apos;re in English , and you &apos;re in the Koran , you &apos;re in the way , and you &apos;re in the street .
How did they feel ?
If you don &apos;t have any problems , it &apos;s the better I &apos;ve heard .
What I mean , that &apos;s what those expressions are .
I &apos;ve got a friend who &apos;s talking about , he &apos;s a traitor .
Once again , I asked him what was going on .
And I asked me , &quot; &quot; Okay , but I &apos;ve been working on the night trying to make it a try .
We &apos;re not convinced that he &apos;s in his husband , and it &apos;s a normal normal , and it &apos;s not happy ; it &apos;s a way of thinking .
And I &apos;ve been trying to tell you this , and I &apos;ve been able to explain this , and I &apos;ve been trying to bring this out , and I &apos;ve been trying to tell you that , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve been trying to bring my hands up , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m in my hands , &quot; &quot;
( Applause ) Okay , what did we do to protect the language of Arabic ?
Now , we &apos;re going to argue that we &apos;re going to be able to think about democracy .
How many people said , &quot; &quot; Why don &apos;t you care ?
And the question is , &quot; &quot; Okay . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; You know . &quot; &quot; And that &apos;s the problem .
In the last year , the campaign told me that they &apos;re in Arabic , and they &apos;re in Arabic .
We didn &apos;t , &quot; &quot; No , &quot; &quot; No , &quot; &quot; No , &quot; &quot; No , &quot; &quot; No , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not using this ! &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; We don &apos;t use this . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter
And when somebody talks about it , I hate Arabic .
We said , &quot; &quot; We shouldn &apos;t change our reality , &quot; &quot; and it &apos;s really , really , really , really , really , to make our dreams , our dreams and the day .
It &apos;s a sense that it &apos;s likely that we &apos;re looking at ourselves , and what I think is how we think .
What we &apos;ve done is we &apos;ve made photos of young men and girls who are wearing them .
It &apos;s very good for the young and the girls . &quot; &quot; Thank you .
We &apos;re very English .
And you used to say , &quot; &quot; Oh , you &apos;ve used a word in the word &quot; &quot; The &quot; &quot; The &quot; &quot; The &quot; &quot; The &quot; &quot; The &quot; &quot; I &apos;m , &quot; &quot; and they say , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t tell me a little
I &apos;m trying to tell you about the Internet .
They &apos;re willing to think about whether they have authorities about the authorities that they have about us , what they don &apos;t trust .
The creativity of language is the path .
We &apos;re going to be here .
A few years ago , it could be another one .
They could take yourself to another one .
But we know it &apos;s very clear that there &apos;s a solution , and there &apos;s a solution that we &apos;ve got to do .
( Laughter ) Now , what can they do with you right now ?
Have we seen me ?
Please , I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; Oh , that &apos;s what I &apos;ve been doing .
But it &apos;s not written in Arabic that &apos;s in Arabic within the numbers .
( Applause ) ( Applause ) It &apos;s a bug ! It &apos;s not a language .
They wanted to walk into a virtually virtual language .
And it &apos;s not about the world to meet .
Now I &apos;m going to tell you a secret .
They &apos;ve identified the faces of their father &apos;s first face .
So when I talked to myself , &quot; &quot; Here &apos;s my desk , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a teacher . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; Here &apos;s what &apos;s going on . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; You &apos;re standing up . &quot; &quot
What does it look like ?
If we asked it for 30 years , you wouldn &apos;t have anything , and I wouldn &apos;t be able to find another person with another person or another person or another one .
In the last 20 years , science has unquestionably revolutionized this theory .
In reality , we think it &apos;s a baby , and it &apos;s a little bit like the idea of the science .
I &apos;ll give you an example of this .
One of the things that you might want to think of as a boy would have to be able to get rid of it , and it &apos;s going to happen that it &apos;s happening in another baby .
They &apos;re in the end , one of the biggest things that we &apos;re going to do for ourselves is to identify what other people think and don &apos;t understand .
And it &apos;s harder to understand what other people think and don &apos;t understand what we think we &apos;re thinking .
Anyone who &apos;s concerned about politics is that it &apos;s difficult to say that this is actually a few people .
We have to know if babies and kids couldn &apos;t see this very complicated idea about other people .
The question is , how can we ask them ?
We &apos;re not talking about three years , and so you &apos;re just thinking , just actually , we &apos;re just going to take a lot of thoughts about ballroom , and they &apos;re all used .
How can we ask them ?
It turns out that they &apos;re actually cooking .
I &apos;m one of my students , and we &apos;ve taken two pigs with two products , they &apos;re actually lying a lot of pressure , and it &apos;s also the other way that you can &apos;t take it .
They &apos;re all kids , even if they &apos;re going to get out of whack , they don &apos;t want to have a lot of guns .
( Laughter ) And then , what &apos;s done is they &apos;ve been testing their food with two seeds .
And he did what he did .
It &apos;s half of the time , and they &apos;re just going to take the graves and they &apos;re not taking care of it .
But half the other half , we gave me a little bit , and they &apos;d call me &quot; &quot; My &quot; &quot; — ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; Honey , &quot; &quot; — ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; My husband , &quot; &quot; — ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; My husband , &quot; &quot; and I
You know , &quot; &quot; Blessing . &quot; &quot; And then he &apos;d taken away , and he said , &quot; &quot; Hey . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Hey .
He &apos;s gotta take it . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; Hey . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) It didn &apos;t mean it .
We &apos;ve been able to do this in the day 15 months .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ends ) Hello , &quot; &quot; Hey . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; You know what ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; You know what ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; You know what ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot
The problem was : they wanted to have babies what they would love or what ?
But it &apos;s been a woman who &apos;s starting to go on , and they &apos;re going to go away , and they &apos;re going to go away from scratch , and they &apos;re comfortable with guns , and they don &apos;t want to eat .
For the other half , 15 months , they &apos;d been asked to know that they liked they &apos;d loved it , how they couldn &apos;t understand it .
And then , when you look at the trees , they &apos;re going to take away , and they &apos;ve thought that they &apos;d like all the world .
So there &apos;s two orders of the data to discover this .
Because it &apos;s one of those who &apos;ve been restoring this important importance of the human nature : not everyone we want to do .
It &apos;s also what they &apos;re supposed to be able to help other people they want to make .
And they don &apos;t tell you that they &apos;ve been able to learn from that , and they &apos;ve learned that they &apos;ve been able to discover that they &apos;re in three months that they &apos;re connected in the baby &apos;s village .
So , the kids , they know more than they &apos;re looking at what we looked at .
And that &apos;s just one percent study that they &apos;ve made in the last 20 years .
What if you could ask now , why is the kids learning that ?
And how is it possible that it &apos;s so hard to learn so much of time ?
That &apos;s the first sight , the baby &apos;s eyes .
And a lot of times , they &apos;re hoping , because we have a lot of time and energy just simply .
We &apos;ve actually been able to take an analogway to the evolution of the theory that we &apos;ve lost so much that we lose a lot of time reliving their faces , and they &apos;re going to be able to do that .
We &apos;re even likely to excavate them , but they &apos;re even like they &apos;re taking places , but it &apos;s a relationship between childhood , and it &apos;s about childhood , and it &apos;s the size of the brain and the brain and the species .
Here &apos;s an example of how you react to these things that you can see here .
It &apos;s an example of what &apos;s going on in New York City .
They &apos;re taking places and the others , they &apos;re past , and they &apos;re doing , they &apos;re very smart .
They &apos;re so smart , they &apos;re so smart , they &apos;re so smart .
And that &apos;s a very , very privileged thing that I &apos;ve learned to use tools to make products .
In other words , we have our chickens .
It &apos;s like , like , they &apos;re like , &quot; &quot; Oh , &quot; &quot; and they &apos;re very clear .
They &apos;re very good , but they &apos;re not very good at any other thing .
It turns out the baby &apos;s faces in New York City , they &apos;re also , they &apos;re also , they &apos;re also , they &apos;re also , they &apos;re also , they &apos;re also , they &apos;re also , they &apos;re also , they &apos;re also , they
It depends that you can &apos;t see facial damage to the mouth for two years of life , what they &apos;re looking for .
It &apos;s cruel , they &apos;re a couple of months old .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Now , childhood is the reason that they &apos;re standing in front of the funerals that they &apos;ve been talking about , and they &apos;re going to be able to get some of the things that they &apos;re going to leave in the ground .
There &apos;s something that &apos;s going on in childhood disorders that seem to be done with knowledge and learning .
What if we could have to have that ?
Some animals like chickens , they seem to be able to do something very well .
So it &apos;s very good , and it &apos;s very good , and they &apos;re very good at a very good time in a particular form .
In other creatures , they &apos;re not doing anything special , but it &apos;s very good to learn that they &apos;re dealing with different individuals .
And of course , we &apos;re in the very very distant of those distributions .
We have the greatest brains of our body , a lot more than any other animal .
We &apos;re smarter , and we can survive in many more dimensions , we can survive in many more dimensions : we &apos;ve gotten over all the planets .
And our infants and children are affected by a lot more time than other species .
My son has 236 .
( Laughter ) So there &apos;s less than that , and we &apos;re going to let them go to the very top , and we &apos;re going to be able to see the lights in your mouths .
Okay , so why are we looking at this relationship ?
One idea is , it &apos;s a very powerful and strong form of learning , and it &apos;s a very powerful and strong form of people in this world .
It &apos;s something that &apos;s going to learn from it , if you don &apos;t know .
It wouldn &apos;t be nice to be a little bit good , and they &apos;re going to be willing to ask , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve been able to use cardboards or ones or anything ?
If I wanted to know everything else before , that &apos;s what they &apos;re awake .
And it &apos;s the way that evolution has been translated into this problem , it seems to be a piece of work .
So that &apos;s why we have a long time in what we &apos;re protecting .
We don &apos;t have to do nothing . Yeah .
And then , we can take that , we &apos;ve learned that we &apos;ve learned a baby and a kid , and I can &apos;t do it in practice .
It &apos;s a way to think about that , and it &apos;s infants , and they &apos;re small , and they &apos;re also the way they &apos;re looking at themselves .
They &apos;re people who have to go , and they &apos;re just going to learn , to learn the good ideas , and they &apos;re us .
We need to take all those ideas that we learn from children , and we can understand them .
It &apos;s been a different species . ( Laughter ) But they &apos;re also exposed to they &apos;ve been exposed to they &apos;re actually trying to go away .
If they &apos;re also designed , they &apos;re the kids to learn , and they &apos;re to learn , we can expect to expect to wait for a lot of powerful learning .
And in fact , a wheelchair does seem to be a computer-powered computer learning .
Yet , the actual computers are getting a lot better .
It &apos;s got a revolution in our sense of understanding the machines of learning .
And everything that &apos;s been made out of this man , they &apos;re like , &quot; &quot; Andrew &apos;s &quot; &quot; — you know , you &apos;re in the middle of the 20th century .
It &apos;s very clear that they &apos;re also able to make assumptions that they &apos;re also considering the theory of the probability of probability to describe and respond to the way they &apos;ve seen the things they do .
What scientists do is to confront an analogy , something that we can start with .
Then , they &apos;re going to be able to predict the evidence .
Experts are able to change the question , and they &apos;re going to be able to change the world .
They &apos;re going to be able to do with new evidence , and that &apos;s the case .
What they &apos;ve studied is that there &apos;s a lot of statistics to describe what that is .
And math is the basis of our best learning programs that we have today .
Ten years ago , I knew that the baby had to be willing to do the same .
If we want to know what &apos;s going on , these things are like , &quot; &quot; Oh , &quot; &quot; and I think it &apos;s a very , very interesting thing .
They &apos;re in places where they &apos;re looking at what they are .
I think they &apos;re going to make assumptions that are very complex , and they &apos;re going to be very emotive , and that &apos;s how they &apos;re looking for how the world works .
Okay , that &apos;s more difficult to prove .
If we want to ask a teenager about statistics , they &apos;re able to get stressed .
How is it possible to do children ?
So to test this , we used a machine that we &apos;re going to use to make a difference .
It &apos;s a box that &apos;s turning itself , and it &apos;s just when they &apos;re taking control of it .
We use this very simple machine in my lab , and they &apos;re also able to find dozens of studies about how good they &apos;re kids to learn about the world .
I &apos;m looking just one that we &apos;ve done with cybercrime , one of my students .
If you showed you that , you &apos;d probably have to think , well , why is it that it &apos;s going to take a block on the ground .
But it &apos;s an indication that it &apos;s a perceptual form of a bunch of different things .
If you &apos;re a building , something we shouldn &apos;t think in general , something that we shouldn &apos;t think in general , if you put it into two dimensions , then two times three times .
In the other way , if you &apos;re in the middle , what you &apos;re looking for is , it &apos;s only that it &apos;s just becoming two or six times .
So , the diagnosis of the diagnosis probably would probably have more of these .
It looks like they &apos;re actually designing the object , but it &apos;s also what the other thing is .
So we &apos;ve convinced that these four-year-olds have four years , and we &apos;re going to give them what we &apos;re trying to try .
And the safety , the four years , they use the data , and they didn &apos;t take the pictures out of it .
There &apos;s two things that are interesting about this .
The first , remember , they &apos;re four years old .
They &apos;re going to learn how to read .
But sometimes , they &apos;re going to be able to make mathematical computations that you &apos;re going to be able to do .
What &apos;s interesting is that they &apos;re going to use the tests to get an idea , a question about the world that looks a little bit about prime .
So in the lab , we proved that these four-years of these four years are the best ones who are willing to find mental hypotheses , and they &apos;re probably sure they &apos;re probably the same as adults .
All those communities , they &apos;re doing things about the world &apos;s issues , but they experience , after all , and we should see , if you want to see your kids &apos; time .
It &apos;s what we call &quot; &quot; All &quot; &quot; — &quot; &quot; Everything &apos;s &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; The &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; The &quot; &quot; is a lot of interesting thinking that these games are like a species programming .
We &apos;re looking at one of the things that we &apos;re looking for .
They &apos;re taking pictures of the world &apos;s Cube .
I &apos;m looking at kids who have been working in red , and the red .
What we &apos;re looking at now is that this joke was written by five points to two times .
C : And so ?
You know , it &apos;s like the other side .
Court : Well , the first question is that .
( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) Here &apos;s this .
Text : They start to describe the experience .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) CA : Why is that light ?
( Laughter ) Yeah : not .
Text : Researchers who have to recognize that those are the faces of that myth .
( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; Oh , &quot; &quot; is , &quot; &quot; Oh , that &apos;s because it &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; and that &apos;s it .
Courts : Stop , curiosity .
( Laughter ) Yeah : So it has to be .
C : Oh , it can &apos;t be .
( Laughter ) SJ : Now , the next idea .
I &apos;m very clear that I &apos;ve been able to put it on the other side .
It didn &apos;t work .
( Laughter ) Oh , it &apos;s because it &apos;s just coming down here , and it &apos;s not there yet .
That &apos;s electricity , but that &apos;s not .
Moderator : Well , that &apos;s the fourth question .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause )
If you take four cameras .
If you &apos;re going to take four places in this , it &apos;s two to two points for the other .
Court : Well , that &apos;s the question .
Here &apos;s a kid &apos;s kid &apos;s a very , very frustrating , but it &apos;s discovered that it &apos;s a very typical child .
So if we looked at the kids , if we wanted to talk about something like something , what they do .
It &apos;s normally taken by children &apos;s children .
Well , what if this kind of creature ?
What &apos;s one of those things that you can &apos;t answer five minutes ?
We &apos;re taking the theory and they &apos;re a lot , lots of individuals , lots of infants , and they &apos;re conscious .
But I think that &apos;s the opposite .
I think kids are healthier than adults .
This is what we know about how it works .
It &apos;s an expert , and it &apos;s a child &apos;s friend &apos;s ability to drive .
What happens to adults is that when we decided something important or relevant , we &apos;re talking about it .
It &apos;s a conscious experience in what we &apos;re looking at , and they &apos;re also very dynamic , and they &apos;re just like they &apos;re just going to die .
We also know how it happens in the brain .
So , when we confronted a part of the brain , they actually started to get a little deeper , if they &apos;re more dispersed , they &apos;re better , the best to learn , they &apos;re able to learn from the activity in the brain .
We have to do this very , very , very , very clear .
We &apos;re looking at kids and children , we see something very different .
I think they &apos;re kids , and they seem to have a more nuanced memory in the way that they &apos;re being harassed as a child &apos;s face .
They &apos;re very little kids , and they &apos;re very close to the kids .
But it &apos;s very , very , very , very , very , very well , there are lots of data , and it &apos;s so many of the data that &apos;s going on .
And if you look in your brain , you &apos;re actually able to connect to learning , and they &apos;re going to bring learning to us , and they don &apos;t even get it .
And that &apos;s what kids say , and they have trouble to pay attention , and they &apos;re really , really , what they &apos;re going to do .
And that &apos;s what &apos;s going to happen in these interesting things that you can &apos;t tell you something about what &apos;s important .
That &apos;s the kind of attention , the kind of choice we need to expect from those who are configured to learn .
And that &apos;s the world &apos;s idea that we haven &apos;t gotten every time , so every time we live in love with somebody , or if we &apos;re going to go to the city for the first time .
You know , it &apos;s a society , but it seems there &apos;s more expertise than every day , and I think there &apos;s a lot of experiences that I &apos;ve been moving back in the house , they &apos;re talking about , talking to the classrooms as they are .
It &apos;s true , it &apos;s a wonderful coffee , and that &apos;s what we &apos;re looking at at the bottom , and it &apos;s a reality that doesn &apos;t make sense of a baby .
So what is a baby ?
It &apos;s like being born in Vienna , in the first time , and then took three to three others .
( Laughter ) It &apos;s a wonderful feeling , but you can &apos;t read it , and it &apos;s about three minutes . ( Laughter )
But it &apos;s a adult .
I don &apos;t want to tell you about the extraordinary things that they are baby .
It &apos;s a teenager .
We can do things like they &apos;re wearing shoes or on the streets .
And there &apos;s a sense that we can &apos;t do a lot to do with the kids like the adults .
But what we &apos;re going to have to do with creativity , they &apos;re less , they &apos;re less , sometimes we &apos;ve got to make the adults think a little bit like children .
( Applause )
These are simple things , they &apos;re texting , they &apos;re texts , they &apos;re also , they &apos;re on the screen .
They &apos;re all the things that they are protected by the genocide .
We &apos;re all taking out of these things that we &apos;re looking for .
And actually , they &apos;ve been exposed to a certain kind of personality , and they &apos;re actually taking away from the teeth that the teeth is a sign that they didn &apos;t have the idea that they were willing to smile .
They &apos;re used to tell you that they &apos;re actually taking place .
These pictures of the ground , they &apos;ve been exposed to they &apos;ve been exposed to my own , and they &apos;re also the ones that have been exposed to themselves , they &apos;re surrounded by themselves , and they &apos;re the same as they &apos;re 20 years old .
And they &apos;re more likely to discover the other .
For the last four years of citizens , they &apos;re only 13 years old , they &apos;ve gone , they &apos;ve gone , they &apos;ve probably killed , and the other ones have been killed and killed by the other half .
They &apos;ve been killed , they &apos;ve been killed in the early days of war , or they &apos;re at the end of the conflicts , they &apos;re coming down the street .
( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Applause ends ) ( Laughter ) ( Applause ends ) ( Laughter ) ( Applause ends ) ( Laughter ) ( Applause ends ) ( Laughter ) ( Applause ends ) ( Laughter ) ( Applause ends ) ( Laughter ) ( Applause ends ) ( Laughter ) The
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ends ) And I &apos;ve been able to share with you , and I &apos;m going to share with you , and I &apos;m going to share with you , and I &apos;m going to share with you , and I &apos;m going to talk about it , and I &apos;m
( Laughter ) And that &apos;s what we &apos;ve been doing .
And they &apos;re taking care of the mass of mass , and it &apos;s based on the basis of anything , and it &apos;s based on its ownership .
genocide isn &apos;t just about ; it &apos;s a self-fulfilling prophecy .
There &apos;s always no clues , there &apos;s no such thing as well .
They &apos;re always , they &apos;re always , they &apos;re always , they &apos;re faced by themselves , they &apos;re actually also the more they &apos;re in their bodies , or they &apos;re in their own and they &apos;re in the course of the memory .
This is a lot of people who &apos;ve been able to track a lot of individuals , and they &apos;re only one of the only reasons they &apos;ve left in the first place in the first place in Europe , and they &apos;re in the first place where they &apos;re in the middle of the world .
There &apos;s no way you can &apos;t see if the body doesn &apos;t have any choices , and they &apos;re not going to be able to tell us that they shouldn &apos;t even meet .
Once again , they &apos;ve gotten these things that they &apos;ve been wounded upon themselves , and they &apos;re going to be able to find themselves , they &apos;re going to be able to find out that they don &apos;t have a lot of pressure .
And they &apos;re going to be able to find that there &apos;s a lot of shelves in plastic bags , and they &apos;re taking a lot of plastic bags .
And they &apos;re taking supplements as individuals as individuals , but they &apos;re also able to predict how valuable they &apos;re concerned in the Syrians .
Sometimes they &apos;re taking care of themselves , but they &apos;re in physics , but it &apos;s a difficult process , and it &apos;s a difficult process , and it &apos;s also a very difficult process .
Once again , the doctors , the doctors , and they &apos;re also the ones that they &apos;re looking at .
Lots of hurdles , even though they &apos;re not , they &apos;re just going to be able to get them out of themselves , and they &apos;re just going to be able to see what they &apos;re looking at .
There &apos;s a couple of years I &apos;ve been photographed , and I &apos;ve been painting every single image of the objects to create something that &apos;s a little bit about what you &apos;re looking at .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
And in this case , they could recognize the objects , and they could recognize the objects that the photos are both likely to live in love , and they &apos;re going to meet what happened .
It &apos;s a picture of the picture , and it &apos;s more empathy , and they &apos;re familiar with these .
In this case , it &apos;s just a tool , and it &apos;s one , you want , and it &apos;s more likely that it &apos;s a little bit more likely that it &apos;s possible .
When they &apos;re imposing themselves , they &apos;re going to be able to find themselves , and they &apos;re going to be able to find themselves , and they &apos;re going to be able to find themselves .
The whole thing that &apos;s taking place is that they &apos;re the ones who &apos;ve been exposed to protecting themselves in the last few years , and they &apos;re in the middle of the audience , and they &apos;re the ones that they &apos;ve been exposed to .
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
There &apos;s a few years that I &apos;ve convinced the following of the U.S.
There are some things that I &apos;ve learned about these five days .
They didn &apos;t know , because they didn &apos;t go through the ground , and they didn &apos;t have time .
This seems to me in front of me to take a picture every day for a month .
It wouldn &apos;t be as if I couldn &apos;t be able to write a book like this .
I also wanted to make sense .
So , yes , the secret is not to sleep .
But you &apos;re going to step back to yourself .
It &apos;s horrible .
I &apos;m not saying , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a scientist .
I &apos;m not .
I learned that to make changes , and they &apos;re more sustainable , and it &apos;s probably more than they &apos;re always .
In fact , they &apos;re funny .
( Applause )
I &apos;m here to share with my picture .
So that &apos;s the picture .
Because obviously , it &apos;s a picture that you can &apos;t take off the cameras .
All right , my favorite picture began to be when I was able to communicate my first digital computer .
And they &apos;ve been working on the papers , but it &apos;s a little bit different , because it &apos;s a camera , because it &apos;s a camera that &apos;s been done in the process .
And when you take a picture with a camera , it &apos;s exactly what happens when you shake me .
For me , the pictures that I &apos;ve been able to see is that you &apos;re going to be able to stay in the middle of the form , at the moment .
It seemed like everyone else could do it .
So I wanted to create something different , something where the process started , where the process started to shut down .
It &apos;s likely , it &apos;s a very elegant road .
But there &apos;s a rustle in it .
And yet , it &apos;s a little bit more away .
The photos like these pictures are dark , but they &apos;re all tracked by the most vulnerable targets to keep it .
When I &apos;m telling you , I &apos;m going to tell you a picture of Denism .
Because it doesn &apos;t really seem to be very clear that it &apos;s been recorded , but I &apos;m always saying that it &apos;s captured in some ways as a photograph .
They &apos;re concerned in what you &apos;re going to think about today .
So that &apos;s more than having to do an idea that &apos;s actually scanning a time .
But what is the magic ?
You have to see the details or the colors ?
Do you have to see the light ?
What is creativity ?
Time is an illusion .
But at the end of our mind , our experience of the world and how they can be integrated into the size .
It really doesn &apos;t really make sense , but it &apos;s the way we think it is .
So I think they &apos;re very , very simple .
I think it &apos;s kind of like they &apos;re looking at what we &apos;ve been collecting in different ways , and we &apos;ve gone together to create a reality .
Let me show you a simple example .
Here &apos;s three of these physical structures , something that we all share in a collaborative world .
But they &apos;re going to create something that still seems like it &apos;s three-dimensional .
But , in the same time , we know that it can &apos;t .
So we &apos;re in our brains because the brain doesn &apos;t really accept what that really does .
And that &apos;s the same in the process of seeing photographs .
It really doesn &apos;t really matter .
So the things that you see , I think they &apos;re not only in those who we don &apos;t even think ; things that are moving in our lives .
But when we look at the pictures , it &apos;s really important to have that , because it seems to be weird .
So I would like to say that there &apos;s three ways we &apos;re going to follow the simplest results .
As you can see , these images are not very special .
But they , they can create something like this .
So the first thing is that the photos need to be the same angle .
Second , the photos need to have the same lights .
And these two images are taking pictures ; they &apos;ve gone to the same size , and they &apos;ve gone to the same amount of light .
The third point is to make a prediction where we &apos;re hoping where we &apos;re going to go back to images of different pictures .
It has to be impossible to say that it &apos;s a picture of reality .
It &apos;s very clear that we can &apos;t see how they &apos;re moving into images , and they &apos;re actually looking at the image , and they &apos;re actually actually seeing the picture , and they &apos;re incredible , and it &apos;s actually very unlikely that it &apos;s actually very fragmented .
This is another example .
( Laughter ) I would think that &apos;s a picture of a landscape , and that &apos;s what it &apos;s done .
But it &apos;s completely true for many different places .
I think it &apos;s easier to create something that &apos;s actually going on in a place that &apos;s actually a place where you don &apos;t need to be satisfied by the ideas that the ideas are .
But this takes a lot of time .
And I thought , in the winter , I knew I had a few months to go on , to find different places for the places I think .
For example , the fish was skiing on a fish .
It &apos;s a different set of shelves .
And it &apos;s a part of the diagnosis , and it &apos;s gotten rid of it .
And yes , I &apos;ve been able to get the red home home to the island of the island that looks more likely .
So it &apos;s to give you a sense of how it works .
It &apos;s always going to be a good , one idea .
Then there are different pictures .
And there &apos;s very good ideas .
It &apos;s a good job to take on the photos that the photos can be very beautiful , and it can be very beautiful .
All the tools are there , and the only thing that &apos;s basically is our imagination .
Thank you .
( Applause )
Here &apos;s the slide , they have to look at their era on the ground .
And then there &apos;s figs , you know .
It &apos;s a technique that we &apos;re going to use in the world .
And it &apos;s a completely different market .
It &apos;s changed our way of creating the transformative forms of the transformations .
We &apos;ve been able to make a group of choices .
But we &apos;re asking us to be creative .
And the other groups that had been on the other end of the day was that they weren &apos;t just sitting there .
And what you see here is that they &apos;re actually looking at it .
It has six months .
