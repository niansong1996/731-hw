<s> there are 175 dressings in my supermarket when you can &apos;t buy the 10 different extra olivenöle and you could buy 12 balsamico-essig that you could buy to make a large amount of your shells , in the unlikely case that none of the voyager in the store is right for you . </s>

<s> there was a time when i was a boy , so you could give every phone of someone , you wanted to go through , you know , he came from the we came to the bell bell . </s>
<s> they hired your phone . they didn &apos;t buy it . ™ . </s>
<s> one consequence of it was that the telephone never broke . </s>

<s> and if you haven &apos;t seen that until in your business , you can be sure they &apos;ll be soon . </s>
<s> and what it does is it causes people to go into business and ask that question . </s>
<s> now do you know what the answer is ? </s>
<s> the answer is no . </s>
<s> it &apos;s not possible to buy a cellphone that &apos;s not too much . </s>
<s> in other aspects of life that are much more sophisticated than buy buying things , the same explosion of choice makes up . </s>
<s> health care -- it &apos;s no longer the case in the united states that will go to the doctor and the doctor tells you what to do . </s>
<s> instead , instead of going to the doctor and the doctor says , we could make a go , or we could make b . </s>

<s> b has these benefits and risks . what do you want to do ? </s>

<s> what do you want to do ? </s>
<s> and if you say , &quot; if you were a doctor , what would you do ? &quot; </s>
<s> the doctor says , &quot; but i &apos;m not . &quot; </s>
<s> the result is -- we call it the patient &apos;s autonomy . that sounds like a good thing , but in reality , a shift of the power of the responsibility of people from someone who knows something -- known by name [postpos.] the doctor -- to someone who knows nothing and have been sick , and so that &apos;s why the best constitution is a decision to make a decision -- known by name [postpos.]
<s> there &apos;s an enormous marketing for ethical drugs drugs for people like you and me , that , if you think about it , doesn &apos;t make any sense , because we don &apos;t buy it . </s>
<s> why do they advertise us if we can &apos;t buy ? </s>
<s> the answer is , you &apos;re going to call us the doctor the next morning and ask for a change of verschreibung . </s>
<s> something like our identity is now a question of choice , how to show this slide . </s>
<s> we to come into one's inheritance no identity , we invent them . </s>
<s> and we often invent ourselves as much as we want . </s>
<s> that means that every day , if they wake up the morning , they need to decide what kind of person they want to be . </s>
<s> in terms of marriage and family , there was a time when the standard-annahme was , that almost everybody had one , and that they could very quickly heirateten as they could , and then how fast as they could . </s>
<s> the only true choice was &quot; who , &quot; not when , and not what they were doing after that . </s>
<s> it &apos;s all easy to have these days . </s>
<s> i teach wonderful intelligent students , and i give you 20 percent less work than i used . </s>
<s> and that &apos;s not because they &apos;re less smart , because they &apos;re less carefully . </s>
<s> it &apos;s because they &apos;re engaged with other things , they ask themselves , &quot; should i be married or not ? shall i get married ? &quot; </s>
<s> should i get married later ? should i have children , or do i do a career ? &quot; </s>
<s> these are all winning manner questions . </s>
<s> and you &apos;re going to answer those questions , whether this means all the tasks that i &apos;m going to zuweise you and not get good grade in my class . </s>
<s> and in fact , they should . these are important to beantwortende questions . </s>
<s> work -- we &apos;re blessed , as cartoons pointed out , the technology that enables us to do every minute from every place on every site on the planet through the randolph hotel . </s>
<s> and by the way , there &apos;s a corner that i &apos;m not going to tell you about , where the wirelesslan works . </s>
<s> i &apos;m not going to tell you because i want to use it . </s>
<s> so what it means is this incredible freedom of choice we &apos;ve got to make decisions in terms of work and again and again and again , whether we should be working or not to work . </s>
<s> we can look at our kids playing in football , and we have our mobile phone on one hip , and our blackberry on another hip , and our laptop is probably on our lap . </s>
<s> and even though they &apos;re all removed , every minute in our child at to garble our child at the to garble of a fußballspiels , we &apos;re also asking ourselves , &quot; should i take that call ? &quot; </s>
<s> should i go into that email ? should i write that letter ? &quot; </s>
<s> and even if the answer to the question , &quot; no , &quot; is surely your experience of the fussballspiels of your child &apos;s prägen very different than it would be . </s>
<s> wherever we look , big stuff and small things , material things and lifestyle , life is a matter of choice . </s>
<s> and the world that we lived in was looking like this . </s>
<s> so i want to say , there were some choices , but not everything was a question of choice . </s>
<s> and the world that we live now looks like this . </s>
<s> and the question is , are the good news or bad news ? </s>
<s> the answer is yes . </s>
<s> we all know what &apos;s good about it , so i &apos;m going to talk about what &apos;s wrong about this . </s>
<s> all of these choices have two effects , two negative effects on people . </s>
<s> an effect , more paradoxical , is to make it lähmt rather than free . </s>
<s> with so many options you can choose , it &apos;s very difficult to decide at all . </s>
<s> i &apos;m going to give you another example of drastisches example , a study of investing in volunteers . </s>
<s> a friend of mine had access to investitions-akten from vanguard , the giant fondgesellschaft of about a million employees and about 2,000 different jobs . </s>
<s> and what she thought was a 10 investmentfonds that the employer were going on , took the participation by two percent . </s>
<s> they offer 50 investmentfonds -- 10 percent less than if they offer only five . why ? </s>
<s> because it &apos;s 50 investmentfonds that are for voting , it &apos;s so hard to decide that you want to choose it in tomorrow . </s>
<s> and then tomorrow , and then tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , of course , never comes . </s>
<s> understand that it &apos;s not just that people need to eat food when they go into retirement because they don &apos;t have enough money to go , because they &apos;re so hard to make decisions that they &apos;re going to miss their employers . </s>
<s> by that they don &apos;t write up to 5,000 dollars a year on the arbeitsgeber that would be happy to reproduce their contribution . </s>
<s> paralysis is a consequence of many choices . </s>
<s> and i think that it causes the world to look like this . </s>
<s> they want to really get the decision right if it &apos;s all eternity , right ? </s>
<s> they don &apos;t want to choose the false investment test , or even the wrong salatdressing . </s>
<s> so this is the one effect . the other effect is that even when we overcome the paralysis and make a decision , we end up getting less content with the outcome of choice than if we had the opportunity to choose between less possibilities . </s>
<s> and there are several reasons for this . </s>
<s> one of them is determined by the great choices of multiple salatdressings when they buy one , and it &apos;s just the idea that they could have been able to make a different decision that would have better , and it &apos;s very easy to imagine that they would have been able to make a different decision , and that regret seems negative to happiness that they made by their
<s> the more opportunities it exists , the more the simple it is to do that at all , that &apos;s disappointing but unsurprising the choice you meet . </s>
<s> secondly , what economists call oppertunitätskosten . </s>
<s> dan gilbert did a great point of this morning today by telling him how much the way we evaluate things to what we compare it . </s>
<s> well , if there &apos;s very many alternatives to think about it , it &apos;s simply attractive properties of the alternative that to exclude from it , that makes you less content with the alternatives they voted . </s>
<s> here &apos;s an example . for those of you who are not new yorkers , i &apos;m sorry . </s>
<s> but here &apos;s what they have to be thinking . </s>
<s> so here &apos;s a couple of to be consensual . </s>
<s> very expensive difficulty . </s>
<s> gorgeous beach . great beach . you got it all for yourself . </s>
<s> what could be better ? &quot; damn &quot; the man thinks , &quot; it &apos;s august . &quot; </s>
<s> everybody in my manhattener neighborhood is gone . </s>
<s> i could park directly in my house . &quot; </s>
<s> and he spends two weeks of the idea that he missed the possibility of having a great parking day on my own . </s>
<s> oppertunitätskosten reduce the happiness we get through our choices , even when that &apos;s what we chose to be fantastic . </s>
<s> and the more opportunities it gives to choices , the more attractive properties of these choices are going to take into account in the oppertunitätskosten . </s>
<s> here &apos;s another example . </s>
<s> well , this cartoon makes some statements . </s>
<s> he makes a point about it right now , and maybe maybe things to do . </s>
<s> but an important point that he &apos;s doing is , you know , you &apos;re always concerned for a matter , you decide to do other things . </s>
<s> and those other things might have attractive properties , and it &apos;s going to do what they &apos;re going to do less attractive . </s>
<s> third , eskalation of expectations . </s>
<s> this got me when i wanted to exchange my jeans . </s>
<s> i wear jeans , almost the time . </s>
<s> and there was a time in which it was only picked up , and they bought it , and they got badly been suitable , they were incredibly incommodious , and if they were carried long enough and often laundered enough , they were going on &quot; ight [sl.] [alright] &quot; . </s>
<s> so , to buy new jeans after many years of the tragens of the old , and i said , &quot; i &apos;d like to put some jeans , here &apos;s my size . &quot; </s>
<s> and the verkäufer said , &quot; do you want lean incentive regulation , or broad expanse or broad expanse ? </s>
<s> do you want buttons or reißverschluss ? stone or drop your acid ? </s>
<s> do you want jeans with holes ? </s>
<s> you want to cut down , cone-shaped , blah , blah blah -- &quot; and so on . </s>
<s> my jaw was down , and after i recovered , i said , &quot; i &apos;d like to have the way that it was the only way . &quot; </s>
<s> and he had no idea what this was , so i spent an hour with each of these damn jeans , and ) the people -- and i &apos;m telling the truth -- with the best appropriate jeans that i had ever had . </s>
<s> i had better . all of that choice made it better to me . </s>
<s> but i felt worse . </s>
<s> why ? i wrote a whole book to explain myself . </s>
<s> the reason for that i felt bad with all these available opportunities , my expectations for what was going on for a good pair of jeans . </s>
<s> i had very low expectations . i didn &apos;t have any plans when they were only in a way . </s>
<s> when they arrived in 100 ways , one of them might have been perfect . </s>
<s> and what i got was good , but it wasn &apos;t perfect . </s>
<s> and so what i did was i compared what i was expecting to do , and what i had been disappointing compared to what i was expecting . </s>
<s> adding the possibilities in the lives of human beings , the expectations of people will have about how well we will be . </s>
<s> and this leads to less satisfaction with results , even though the results are good . </s>
<s> nobody in the world of marketings knows this . because if you would , you didn &apos;t know what it &apos;s about . </s>
<s> the truth is more like this . </s>
<s> the reason is that it used to be much better than everything was bad than anything that was worse for people to make experience that were a pleasant surprise . </s>
<s> today , in the world that we live in -- we &apos;re wealthy , industrialized citizens , with perfection as an expectation -- the best for you to hope is to be as good as you would be paying . </s>
<s> you &apos;re never going to be pleasant überrascht. because your expectations , my expectations , are as high as a house . </s>
<s> the secret to the glücklichkeit -- that &apos;s what you &apos;ve been seeing -- the secret to glücklichkeit are low expectations . </s>
<s> i want to say -- a short short moment -- i &apos;m married with a woman , and she &apos;s really wonderful . </s>
<s> i couldn &apos;t do it better . i couldn &apos;t get myself . </s>
<s> but to let down isn &apos;t always a bad thing . </s>
<s> ultimately , a consequence of kaufens a bad piece of paper when it &apos;s only to buy a way to buy , and you wonder , &quot; why , who &apos;s sick , the answer is responsible . the world is responsible . what could you have done ? </s>
<s> if hundreds of different kinds of jeans are available , and you &apos;re going to buy one that &apos;s disappointing but unsurprising , and you ask why , who &apos;s in charge ? </s>
<s> it &apos;s also clear that the answer to the question is you . </s>
<s> they could have done it better . </s>
<s> with 100 different kinds of jeans in the schaufenster , there &apos;s no excuse for mistakes . </s>
<s> and so when people make decisions , and even when the results of decisions are good , they feel comfortable about it , they blame themselves . </s>
<s> clinical depression exploded in the industrial world over the last generation . </s>
<s> i think a significant difference -- not the only one , but a significant difference beiträger to this explosion of depression , and also also , is that people have learned the disappointing but unsurprising because their standards are so high , and then , if you have to explain that experience yourself , think about it . </s>
<s> and so the bilanzergebnis is that it &apos;s okay to us in general , more objective , and we feel worse . </s>
<s> so let me remind you . </s>
<s> this is the official dogma , which we &apos;re all holding to be right , is completely wrong . it &apos;s not true . </s>
<s> there &apos;s no question that something is better than not , but it doesn &apos;t move that much more choices than a choice . </s>
<s> there &apos;s a magic crowd . i don &apos;t know what it is . </s>
<s> and i &apos;m pretty sure that we &apos;ve missed this point for a long time , and that &apos;s what we &apos;ve seen . </s>
<s> now , as a grundsatz question -- i &apos;m almost done -- as a moral question , the thing about thinking about this . this is what all of these choices enabled in the industrialized societies , is the material &apos;s wealth . </s>
<s> there are a lot of places in the world , and we &apos;ve heard of a lot of them that &apos;s not a lot of a lot of a problem . </s>
<s> their problem is they have too little . </s>
<s> so the things that i &apos;m talking about are a strange problem of modern , rich , western societies . </s>
<s> and what &apos;s so frustrating and sad : steve levitt told you yesterday about how those expensive and hard to clean car seats don &apos;t help . it &apos;s a waste of money . </s>
<s> what i &apos;m telling you is that these expensive , complicated decisions -- it &apos;s not easy that they don &apos;t help . </s>
<s> they actually hurt it . </s>
<s> they worry about that we are there . </s>
<s> if something of what the people of our society are creating to make so decisions in the places that people were going to move to very little choices , would not only improve people &apos;s lives , but our dignity would be better . </s>
<s> economists call this an pareto-verbesserungs application . </s>
<s> einkommensumverteilung is going to worry that it &apos;s getting better stuff -- it &apos;s not just the poor -- because all of these wide variations are plagt us . </s>
<s> finally , read this cartoon , and , advanced technology person , says , &quot; ah ! what does this fish know ? </s>
<s> you don &apos;t know anything in this room . &quot; </s>
<s> verarmten imagination , a short-sighted policy view of the world -- and that &apos;s the way i read it first . </s>
<s> but the more i thought , the more i came to the point that fish knows something . </s>
<s> because the truth is that if you break the goldfischglas , so it &apos;s all possible , you don &apos;t have freedom . you have paralysis . </s>
<s> if you break the goldfischglas , so it &apos;s all possible , it lifts the happiness . </s>
<s> they increase the paralysis and reduce happiness . </s>
<s> everybody needs a goldfischglas . </s>
<s> this is almost bounded with perfect security -- possibly for fish , definitely for us . </s>
<s> but the movable thing either lost or stolen to sell oneself short is a recipe for misery , and , i guess , katastrophe . </s>
<s> thank you very much . </s>
<s> you know , i &apos;ve talked about some of these projects before , about the human genome and what might mean , and over the discovery of new groups of genes . </s>
<s> we actually start off a new point , and we &apos;ve digitized biology , and now we &apos;re trying to get to the digital code in a new phase of biology by designing new life and building . </s>
<s> we &apos;ve always tried to ask meaningful questions . </s>
<s> what is life ? it &apos;s something that i think there &apos;s a lot of biologists trying to understand and that on different levels . </s>
<s> we &apos;ve tried different ways to simplify it down to the minimum components . </s>
<s> we &apos;ve been digitized for almost 20 years . when we sequenced the humangenom , the transition of the informal world of biology is in the digital world of the computer . </s>
<s> now let &apos;s try to wonder whether we can regenerate or do we can make new life from this digital universe ? </s>
<s> this is the map of a small organism , mycoplasma geitalium , the smallest genome of a species that can replicate itself in the lab , and we &apos;ve tried to do that with a smaller genome . </s>
<s> we &apos;ve been able to do about 100 genes from the 500 or something that are here . </s>
<s> but if we look at this metabolic map that is very simple , compared to ours . trust me , that &apos;s easy , but if we all look at all the genes we can eliminate one by another one after another , it &apos;s very unlikely that it would lead to a living cell . </s>
<s> so we decided it &apos;s the only way to put this chromosome in the front of the world , which allows us to vary the individual components and put some of the fundamental questions . </s>
<s> and so with the question , we began to make a chromosome ? </s>
<s> does it allow the chemistry to make these really large molecules that have never been done before ? </s>
<s> and if we can do that , can we start the chromosome ? </s>
<s> now , a chromosome is a piece of inert gas chemical materials by the way . </s>
<s> our steps at the digitalisierung of life was exponentially . </s>
<s> writing our ability to write genetic code has been evolving very slowly , and yet our last point would be on an exponential graph now . </s>
<s> we started with it 15 years ago . </s>
<s> it took me a few years away with a bioethischen review , before we made the first experiments . </s>
<s> it turns out that dna-synthetisierung is very difficult . </s>
<s> so there &apos;s tens of thousands of machines around the world that can make small pieces of dna , 30 to 50 letters long , but it &apos;s a very complicated process , so the longer you make a piece of power that happens more errors . </s>
<s> so we had to do a new approach with which we put these little bits and to emend the mistakes . </s>
<s> this was our first attempt with the digital information , the genome phi x . </s>
<s> it &apos;s killing a small virus of bacteria . </s>
<s> we made little bits , we made a fehlerkorrektur , and we had about about 5,000 letters . </s>
<s> the exciting phase came when we took this piece of inerte chemical and put it into bacteria , and the bacteria began reading the genetic code and made viral particles . </s>
<s> the viral particles were then R-rated [Am.] from the cells and came back and killed e. coli . </s>
<s> i was talking to the oil industry recently , and they told that they mean this model . </s>
<s> they laughed more than you do it . </s>
<s> so we think that this is a situation in software that can actually build your own hardware in a biological system . </s>
<s> but we wanted to go much further . we wanted to build a whole bacterial metabolite chromosome . so we thought we were building it in kassetten and genetischen genetischen . </s>
<s> design is the key , and if you start to start with digital information in the computer , this digital information needs to be really accurate [free from error or defect] . </s>
<s> when we sequenced the genome in 1995 , the fehlerrate was one of a fehler per hour or part thereof . </s>
<s> we found out at the resequenzieren 30 mistakes . if we used the original sequence , it would never have been possible . </s>
<s> part of the design is to make pieces that are 50 letters long , and that have to overlap with other 50-buchstaben bits to build smaller sub-einheiten . </s>
<s> we put unique things in there . </s>
<s> you may have heard that we &apos;ve built waterzeichen . </s>
<s> think about it : we &apos;ve got a 4-buchstaben code : a , c , g and t. </s>
<s> triplets of these letters -- these letters encode about 20 amino acids ; and there &apos;s a single purpose for each of these amino acids . </s>
<s> so we can use the genetic code to write our words , sentences , thoughts . </s>
<s> at first we only signed . </s>
<s> some people were disappointed that it was not poetry . </s>
<s> we designed the bits so that we could just to differentiate in them with enzymes , and there are enzymes that can fix them and bring back . </s>
<s> and we &apos;ve started to make pieces of pieces , starting with bits of the five to four thousand letters , put these together together to go back and bring it together to 72.000 . </s>
<s> in each step , we took these pieces into the surplus so we could sequence it because we tried to create a very robust process , what they &apos;re going to see in a minute . </s>
<s> we tried to get the automation . </s>
<s> so , this looks like a basketball-playoff . </s>
<s> if we are going to this really large pieces -- with over 100,000 pairs pairs -- it &apos;s not going to grow in saudi coli . it &apos;s going to expand all the opportunities of modern biological biology , and that &apos;s how we ended up with other mechanisms . </s>
<s> we knew about a mechanism called the homologous chromosomes rekombination that uses biology to repair dna that can give up these pieces . </s>
<s> here &apos;s an example of it . there &apos;s an organism called deinococcus radiodurans of the three million rads of radiation . </s>
<s> you notice in the upper field that its chromosome is simply falling apart . </s>
<s> for 12 to 24 hours later , it all happened back like this . </s>
<s> we have thousands of organisms that can do this . </s>
<s> these organisms can be totes adorbs [sl.] [totally adorable] , they can actually live in vacuum . </s>
<s> i &apos;m absolutely sure that life exist in space and can move to the search of aquatischen conditions . </s>
<s> indeed , nasa has shown that there &apos;s a lot of people out there . </s>
<s> now , there &apos;s this molecule that we made by the molecule that we &apos;ve been using by using these processes -- actually , we &apos;ve only used hefe-mechanismen with the right design of the pieces , we &apos;ve eingepasst it . yeast , then , automatically add this together . </s>
<s> this is not elektronenmikroskopaufnahme . it &apos;s a regular working hours mikroskopaufnahme . </s>
<s> it &apos;s such a big molecule that we can actually see it with the lichtmikroskop . </s>
<s> these are footage in about a week of six seconds . </s>
<s> this is the publication that we &apos;ve been asking . </s>
<s> these are over 580.000 letters of genetischem code . it &apos;s the largest molecule with definierter structure that has ever been created by humans . </s>
<s> it has a molekulargewicht of over 300 million . </s>
<s> if we were to look at it with a schriftgröße from 10 and without setting it , it would contain 142 pages , just to auszudrucken this genetic code . </s>
<s> so , how do we start a chromosome ? how do we get it ? </s>
<s> clearly , it &apos;s very easy to do with a virus . it &apos;s much more complicated with bacteria . </s>
<s> it &apos;s also easier to think of it as much as we &apos;re doing it . you just take the nucleus out and put another inside , and that &apos;s exactly what you all heard about cloning . </s>
<s> in archaebakterien , the chromosome is embedded into the cell , but recently , we &apos;ve shown you that you can do a complete copy of a pair of chromosomes that can be made by a cell . </s>
<s> we reinigten the chromosome of a mikrobenspezies : roughly speaking , and we gave some extra-gene to this chromosome , and we put it with enzymes around all of them like humans and mice . and it was very surprising when we put it into a cell -- and they &apos;re going to appreciate our very sophisticated visual . </s>
<s> the new chromosome went into the cell . </s>
<s> in fact , we thought that this is the end , but we tried to get a little bit more the process . </s>
<s> this is the hauptmechanismus of evolution here . </s>
<s> we &apos;re finding all sorts of species that have a second chromosome , or a third of from somewhere (or other) , each of the characteristics in only one second to a species . </s>
<s> so people who think of evolution as a gene that will have changed as a gene that will have a lot of biology . </s>
<s> and there &apos;s enzymes that are called restriktionsenzyme , which actually digest dna . </s>
<s> the chromosome that was in the cell has none ; the chromosomes that we &apos;ve added has been . </s>
<s> it was expressed in the cell and recognized the other chromosome as the foreign material , and so we ended up with only one cell with a new chromosome . </s>
<s> it discolored teeth [Am.] blue because of the genes we put . </s>
<s> and after a very short time , it had lost all of the characteristics of species and konvertierte completely into a new species based on the new software that we put in the cell . </s>
<s> all proteins changed the membranes -- when we were reading the genetic code , it was just what we &apos;ve been screaming . </s>
<s> it may sound like biomedical alchimie , but we can , by the way we move the software-dna , things change quite dramatic . </s>
<s> now i argued that this is not the &quot; genesis &quot; -- that &apos;s based on 3.5 billion years of evolution . </s>
<s> and i argued that we might be able to create a new form of the planetary explosion in which it could give massive new artenbildung based on this digital design . </s>
<s> why should we do that ? </s>
<s> i think it &apos;s quite obvious in terms of what we need . </s>
<s> we &apos;re anzuwachsen by six billion people in the next 40 years . </s>
<s> to put it in my context , i was born in 1946 . </s>
<s> today , three people on this planet are in 1946 for every one who has existed in 1946 ; within 40 years , it will be four . </s>
<s> we have problems with food , with fresh and safe water , medicine , treibstoff billion people . </s>
<s> it &apos;s going to offer a challenge for 9 . </s>
<s> we need over five billion tons of coal , 30-plus billion water panels -- these are 100 million water panels that day . </s>
<s> if we think about biological processes or any processes to replace this , it becomes a huge challenge . </s>
<s> then , of course , there &apos;s the whole co2 from this stuff that lands in the atmosphere . </s>
<s> we have now , from our discoveries all over the world , a database with about 20 million genes , and i want to believe that these are the designkomponenten of the future . </s>
<s> the elektronikindustrie had a dozen components , and look at the diversity that came out of it . </s>
<s> so , we run in the first line of the limits of biological reality and to this kind of idea . </s>
<s> we &apos;ve got technology today , because of these fast synthesemethoden , to do what we call deductive work genetics . </s>
<s> so we now have the ability to build a large large robot that can produce millions of chromosomes a day . </s>
<s> if you think of these 20 million kinds of genes , or to optimize these kinds of different genes to produce more effective , or medicine new vaccines , we can change more molecular biology than the last 20 years . </s>
<s> and it &apos;s just nurmale selection . we can use lebensfähigkeit to screen , production of chemicals or treibstoffproduktion impfstoffproduktion and so on . </s>
<s> this is a shot of actual design-software that we &apos;re working on , where you actually sit down and you design new species on your computer . </s>
<s> you know , we don &apos;t necessarily know what it &apos;s going to look like . we know exactly what the genetic code is going to be like . </s>
<s> now , we focus on efficiency of the fourth generation . </s>
<s> they &apos;ve recently seen corn as a bad experiment . </s>
<s> we have fuels of zweiten- and third generation , which are relatively recently , that are going to have a lot of larger zuckerwertigkeiten , like oktan or different kinds of butanol . </s>
<s> but , as we think , the only way we think the only way to create biology is the only way that it &apos;s going to have a huge amount of energy in the cost of the cost of energy , or the einschränkung of the ausgangsmaterial . </s>
<s> and we think we &apos;re going to be the first one with treibstoffen &apos;s fourth generation , and that in about 18 months . </s>
<s> sunlight and co2 are a method . </s>
<s> but in our discovery , we all have different kinds of methods . </s>

<s> it lives in the deep sea , around ein-einhalb miles deep , in virtually kochenden wassertemperaturen . </s>
<s> it wandelt co2 in methane to use hydrogen by using hydrogen as source . </s>
<s> we can study if we can use stored program co2 that could easily be brought up to produktionsplätzen , to bring over the co2 in fuel to drive this process . </s>
<s> in a very short period of time , we think we could be able to solve one of the most fundamental questions of life . </s>
<s> you know , we really -- moderate prices targets like replacement the whole petrochemischen industry . right . if you could do that at ted , where else ? a hauptquelle of energy . </s>
<s> but in the same way , we now are working on the same of the same kinds of vaccines . </s>
<s> you &apos;ve seen it this year with flu , we &apos;re always going on in the back and have a dollar too little when it comes to the right vaccine . </s>
<s> and i think that &apos;s going to be changed by creating recombinant DNA vaccines in the vorhinein . </s>
<s> this is what the future might be able to look like with changes today , can accelerate the evolutionsbaum with synthetic bacteria , archaen , and potentially eukaryonten . </s>
<s> we &apos;re lichtjahre light from the distance . and our goal is that we &apos;re going to have a chance to survive long enough to potentially do that . thank you very much . </s>
<s> on the last conference , i gave an introduction to the lhc . </s>
<s> and i promised to come back to explain how the machine works . </s>
<s> so it &apos;s the same way . and for those of you who are not there , the lhc is the largest scientific experiment ever been addressed -- 27 miles in the diameter . </s>
<s> his job is to create conditions that exist less than a milliardstel second at the beginning of the universe -- and that to 600 million times in a second . </s>
<s> it &apos;s just breathtaking ambitious . </s>
<s> this is the machine underneath geneva . </s>
<s> we take images like this in detectors . </s>
<s> this is what i work on . it &apos;s called the installation detector -- 44 meters in the total , 22 meters in diameter . </s>
<s> this is a spectacular picture of the atlas in construction so you see the scale . </s>
<s> on september 10 , last year , the machine ran out . </s>
<s> and this picture was taken by sandy . </s>
<s> it causes huge jubel in control . </s>
<s> it &apos;s an image of the first strahlenpartikels that &apos;s all the way around the lhc , then advisedly with a part of the lhc to get a rain from particles to the detector . </s>
<s> in other words , when we saw this image at 9 / 11 , we knew that the machine works , which is a great victory . </s>
<s> i don &apos;t know if this generated all of this the biggest jubel , or to do this as someone vorfand the google side and found the page like this . </s>
<s> it means we &apos;ve achieved a cultural impact next to the scientific . </s>
<s> about a week later , there was a problem with the machine that had to do with that wires -- this golden drähte . </s>
<s> these wires are running 13-tausend , when the engine is running on hochleistung . </s>
<s> now , the engineers among you are going to look at them and say , &quot; no , no you do . these are little wires . &quot; </s>
<s> you can afford that because if you blow them up very far , they become something called supraleitern . </s>
<s> so by minus 271 degrees , cooler than the place between stars , the wires can withstand that tension . </s>
<s> in one of the compounds , between over nine thousand magnets in the lhc , there was a manufakturdefekt . </s>
<s> it turns out the wires and 13-tausend ampere , suddenly , begegneten resistance . </s>
<s> this was the result . </s>
<s> now , this is all wonderful when you think that the magnet will weigh over 20 tons and move around about 30 inches . </s>
<s> so we damaged about 50 of the magnet . </s>
<s> and they had to take out what we were doing . </s>
<s> we konditionierten it , they reparierten it . </s>
<s> they &apos;re now back on their path . </s>
<s> by the end of march , the lhc will be executable again . </s>
<s> we &apos;re going to be able to be able to collect it in june , and to collect the first data in june or july , and put our journey forward to figure out what are the tiles in the universe . </s>
<s> well , of course , in some ways , the debate of these accidents are , again , the debate about the value of science and ingenieurskunst . it &apos;s easy to reject something like this . </s>
<s> and i think that the fact that it &apos;s so hard , the fact that we go beyond our borders , it involves the value of things like the lhc . </s>
<s> i &apos;m going to leave my abschließenden words of an english scientist , humphrey davy , who i suspect , when he was doing the most dangerous to the development of human spirit , that there was no such mystery for the development of human spirit , that there is no mystery in nature that our triumphe are complete complete , and that there &apos;s no new worlds . &quot;
<s> thank you . </s>
<s> i am jewish . </s>
<s> to write books is my job , but of course , more than that . </s>
<s> it &apos;s also my big , womb-to-tomb security love and fascination . </s>
<s> and i don &apos;t expect that ever to change . </s>
<s> however , recent is a little bit weird in my life and my career , that has led me to rethink my relationship with this work completely . </s>
<s> this strange event was that i was writing a book recently -- a biography called „ eat , pray , love “ -- that , decided to be different from all my previous books in the world , was a huge mega-ereignis , international bestseller-ding . </s>
<s> the result is that i don &apos;t care where i &apos;m coming , that i would be treated by the fall of antlered . </s>
<s> seriously , the untergang ! </s>
<s> for example , they get really concerned to me and say , &quot; don &apos;t you dare that you never get asked that success ? </s>
<s> do you don &apos;t worry that you weiterschreiben your whole life and never make a book that &apos;s anybody in the world ? never again ? </s>
<s> okay , that &apos;s really the courage . </s>
<s> it would be worse if i didn &apos;t remind myself that i was going to remind myself that i was at the time of 20 years ago , that i was told to be a writer with the same kind of angstbesetzter response . </s>
<s> people said , don &apos;t you worry to have succeeded , never ? </s>
<s> don &apos;t you worry that the humiliation of a absage kill ? </s>
<s> do you don &apos;t worry that you were going to nachgehst your life for your life and never happen to it , and that you &apos;re going to die in an schrotthaufen , busted condom dreams -- your mouth filled with the bitter ashes of failure ? </s>
<s> so , sort of , you know . </s>
<s> the answer -- the short answer to all of these questions is : „ . “ . </s>
<s> yeah , i &apos;m afraid about all of these things . </s>
<s> and i kept that . </s>
<s> and i &apos;m afraid a lot more things that no one was going on . </s>
<s> like algae -- and other furchteinflößende things . </s>
<s> but , when it comes to writing , i &apos;ve been thinking about it and ask myself : why ? </s>
<s> is it rational ? </s>
<s> is it logical that you should be expected by being afraid to do the work that he feels ? </s>
<s> and what &apos;s right with the creative company that you can &apos;t do with the creative health company -- in a way that other professions aren &apos;t doing ? </s>
<s> my father , for example , was chemist , and i can &apos;t remember any situation in his 40 years when chemists were asked to be a chemist . </s>
<s> with your chemiker-blockade , john -- how does it do ? </s>
<s> it just didn &apos;t matter , you know ? </s>
<s> but to be fair , the group of chemists , over the centuries , have no idea of ruf people &apos;s reputation . </s>
<s> but what we said was this because we were writers to have this kind of reputation , but not only the writers , but the creative of all genres , seem to have this reputation , mentally being terribly unstable . </s>
<s> all they have to do is to look at the bitter line of really great minds just from the 20th century who died young and often died of their hand . </s>
<s> and even those who didn &apos;t actually use suizid , they were really neglected by their talents . </s>
<s> norman mailer said , just before he died from his death in his last interview . „ each of my books made me a little further . </s>
<s> extraordinary wonder you can do about your work . </s>
<s> but we don &apos;t even get that if we hear someone say something because we &apos;ve known that kind of to claim [assert] and a lot of time . somehow , you know , we &apos;ve seen the perception so much and collective , that creativity and suffering , of course , to belong together and that art -- at the end , leads to seelenqual . </s>
<s> the question that i &apos;m going to ask everybody here today : is this an idea for you all right ? </s>
<s> are you feeling with it ? because at just a centimeter distance -- i don &apos;t even feel that . </s>
<s> i think they &apos;re abhorrent . </s>
<s> and i think they are dangerous , and i don &apos;t want to see it coming into the next century . </s>
<s> i think it &apos;s better when we &apos;re encouraging our great creativity . </s>
<s> and i would definitely know that for me -- in my situation , it would be very dangerous to start , this dark path of reasoning kind of herunterzusickern -- especially the fact that i was in my career . </s>
<s> this is called -- look , i &apos;m pretty young . i &apos;m only about 40 years old . </s>
<s> i still have another 40 arbeitsjahre in me . </s>
<s> and it &apos;s very likely that all i &apos;m going to write from now are used by the world as the labor , which came out of the abgefahrenen success of my last book , right ? </s>
<s> i &apos;m saying it baldly , because we &apos;re all kind of friends -- it &apos;s very much likely to get my biggest success behind me . </s>
<s> oh , jesus , what a thought ! </s>
<s> these are the kind of thoughts that can be able to get somebody to start at 9 o &apos;clock in the morning . and that &apos;s not what i want . </s>
<s> i would always be doing that work that i love . </s>
<s> so the question is : how ? </s>
<s> and after some time of reflektierens , i &apos;m sure that i can continue to write and write a kind of schützendem psychological construction . </s>
<s> and somehow i &apos;ve got to go from a way of writing a safe distance to real distance between me and my very natural beklemmung about what &apos;s going to be the response to the literature . </s>
<s> as i was looking for models in this last year , i &apos;ve been looking for models in the past , and i &apos;ve tried to find other societies to see if you &apos;ve been able to find new societies to see if you could be able to help the emotional risks that are connected to creativity . </s>
<s> this quest led me to old literature and the old rome . </s>
<s> please follow me , because the circle is going to close again . </s>
<s> but in ancient literature and rome , people didn &apos;t believe that creativity comes from . okay ? </s>
<s> they believed that creativity was a sort of divine spark diener-geist that comes from a distant , unknown source to the people -- from unerklärlichen , current location unknown reasons . </s>
<s> the greeks , they called these göttlichen diener-geister of creativity dämonen dämonen . </s>
<s> now , of socrates , he believed that he thought he had a dämon dämon him . </s>
<s> the romans , the romans , had the same idea of körperlosem creative spirit . </s>
<s> this is great . the granny , not really thought that a genius was particularly smart individual . </s>
<s> they believed that a genius that was really magical with this sort of magical theurgy thing was that it was literally living in the walls of a künstlerateliers -- roughly like dobby , the hauself , the rauskäme -- the rauskäme and the artist , in some sense , would be invisible ventilatory assistance and the result of the work . </s>
<s> this is brilliant -- there it is , there &apos;s the distance that i talked about -- the psychological setup that protect you from your work . </s>
<s> and everybody knew that it worked , right ? </s>
<s> the artist of the altertums was somewhat protected to certain things , like , for example , too much complacency , right ? </s>
<s> if your work were brilliant , you couldn &apos;t look at everything for you . everybody knew that you had this körperlose genius that has helped you . </s>
<s> if your work floppte -- not necessarily your mistakes , right ? </s>
<s> everybody knew her genius was paralyzed . </s>
<s> so people in the west thought about creativity for a very long time . </s>
<s> and then the renaissance and changed . we had this great idea , and this big idea was : let &apos;s put the human individual in the center of the universe -- across all the gods and mysteries , and there &apos;s no room to make a room for geologic creatures that take orders of göttlichen . </s>
<s> it &apos;s the beginning of the rational humanismus , and the people started to believe that creativity came entirely from its individual . </s>
<s> for the first time in history , you &apos;re listening to people who call this artist a genius -- instead of saying that he has a genius . </s>
<s> i have to tell you , i think that was a big mistake . </s>
<s> you know ? i think a neurologist person to allow anybody to think that he thinks he thinks he or the essence and the source of all divine , creative , unbekanntem , infinite mysteriums is a little bit too responsibility to aufzubürden her , human psyche . </s>
<s> it &apos;s like asking someone to swallow the sun . </s>
<s> the defaced and the biased part and it bred all these unerreichbaren expectations in success . </s>
<s> and i think that that erfolgs-druck has been annihilated by the last 500 years . </s>
<s> and when that is true , and i think it &apos;s true -- is the question . </s>
<s> can we change it ? </s>
<s> maybe an ancient understanding about the relationship between humans and the mystery of the creative . </s>
<s> maybe not . </s>
<s> maybe we can &apos;t just humanismus to complete what was said humanismus . </s>
<s> and there are certainly people in this audience who would really to declare legitimate complaint scientific doubts about the idea of -- essentially -- feen that are using people to come next and feenzauber on their projects . </s>
<s> i &apos;m probably not going to take all of you on this journey . </s>
<s> but the question i want to talk about is why not ? </s>
<s> why not think about it ? </s>
<s> because it does just as much sense like anything else i &apos;ve been hearing , when it was about explaining the absolutely crazy machende launenhaftigkeit . </s>
<s> a process that -- like everybody knows , it has tried to do something -- so in other words , everybody here -- actually everybody here -- don &apos;t always behave in any way . </s>
<s> in fact , it can sometimes feel paranormal . </s>
<s> i recently had one of those encounter when i met the extraordinary american poet ruth stone , who was now about 90 , but she told me that she was working out of her dörflichen virginia , she was working outside the fields , and she said she would feel like a poem about her landscape . </s>
<s> she would say it would be like a thunderous applause train . </s>
<s> that was on her zurollen . </s>
<s> she felt when it came , because it would bring the earth under their feet . </s>
<s> she knew that she could only do anything like that in such a moment , and that was in their words -- „ race like “ . </s>
<s> she ran like the devil to the house as she was tracking by this poem , and it was only about making sure that she had to get fast enough to a piece of paper and a pen so that she could catch it through her through her , catch and to adhere on her . </s>
<s> in other occasions , it wasn &apos;t fast enough . they ran and ran and ran , and the poem didn &apos;t jump through them and they missed it through them and she missed it . she said it would go on to over country and -- how she said -- „ after a different poet . </s>
<s> and then there were these moments -- i &apos;m never going to forget -- she said that moments gave them almost missed chance . </s>
<s> so , she runs the house and after the paper after the paper and the poem goes through them , and she &apos;s taking a pen right now than she hindurchgeht by her , and then she -- she said , it was like it &apos;s going to reach with her other hand and get it . </s>
<s> she caught up the poem of his tail and pulled it back in her body and took it on the sheet of paper . </s>
<s> in that opportunity , the poem passes in and intact on paper -- but backwards -- the last word . </s>
<s> so when i heard that i thought i was really excited -- that &apos;s exactly what my creative process is doing . </s>
<s> it &apos;s not like my creative process -- i &apos;m not the channel . </s>
<s> i &apos;m a maultier . to work , i need to get up every day at the same time and to cause perspiration , abmühen me and really uncomfortable out . </s>
<s> but even i did this thing banded sometimes . </s>
<s> and i guess many of you have done this too . </s>
<s> i had been working on work or some ideas that i can &apos;t identify from a source that i can really identify . </s>
<s> what &apos;s that thing to do ? </s>
<s> and how do we deal with it without losing our minds , but to keep ourselves in intellectual health ? </s>
<s> for me , the best living example for me is how to do this , the musicians tom waits . i could interview it for a magazine a few years ago . </s>
<s> we talked about this issue . and you know what ? most of the time of his life was tom &apos;s embodiment of the gepeinigten modern artist , trying to defeat those unkontrollierbaren creative pulses that were living in it . </s>
<s> but then he became older and quiet . he told me that he was going on a schnellstraße in los angeles , and there was all for him . </s>
<s> he drove up with high speed when he suddenly sounds a little fragment of a tune , which he often is , is very beneficial for inspiration , and he wants to . it &apos;s gorgeous . it &apos;s gorgeous . it lechzt it , but it can &apos;t trust it . </s>
<s> he &apos;s got no paper , he has no pen , he didn &apos;t have a kassettenrekorder . </s>
<s> so it begins , these old beklemmung are going up in him , like „ , i &apos;m going to lose this thing and get shot by this song . </s>
<s> i &apos;m not good enough , i can &apos;t . </s>
<s> but instead of getting into panic , it just stopped . </s>
<s> he ended all the gedankengang and did something completely new . </s>
<s> he just looked into the sky and he said , &quot; „ , you know , can &apos;t you see that i &apos;m driving cars ? &quot; </s>
<s> „ are the ones that i &apos;m going to read a song ? </s>
<s> if you really want to exist , come back to a moment &apos;s moment , if i can take care of you . </s>
<s> if you don &apos;t , somebody else else . </s>
<s> go along and do quäle &apos; cohen cohen . </s>
<s> his whole arbeitsprozess has changed . </s>
<s> not the work of itself . it &apos;s always been as dark as ever ever . </s>
<s> but the process and the heavy beklemmung that it surrounds was when he took the genius from himself , where it was not an equilibrium , where it was creating nothing but trouble , where it zurückließ , where it came from . he realized that there was no verinnerlichtes , agonizing problem thing . </s>
<s> it could give you a idiosyncratic turn of phrase , brilliant , bizarre collaboration , a kind of conversation between tom and the fremdartigen , äußerlichen thing that was not entirely tom . </s>
<s> when i heard this story , it also changed the way i worked , and it &apos;s been saved me . </s>
<s> this idea saved me when i was in the middle of „ eat from „ eat , pray , love “ . i fell into one of the zweifels of the zweifels that we all to go off to work when we do something and it didn &apos;t work . you start to think that it &apos;s going to be a disaster that &apos;s been written . </s>
<s> not only bad , but the worst of all time . </s>
<s> so i started thinking , well , i should just einstampfen this project . </s>
<s> but then i remember what tom was talking about in the wild sky and i tried it . </s>
<s> so i took my look at the manuscript and i spoke my comments towards an empty corner of the room . </s>
<s> i was talking loudly : „ listening , you do , you and i know when this book isn &apos;t brilliant , that it &apos;s not completely my fault , right ? </s>
<s> because you see i &apos;m investing with everything i have . i don &apos;t have any more than that . </s>
<s> so if you want to get it better , you &apos;ve got to to come around  [show up] up here and cover your proportion of action . </s>
<s> okay . but if you don &apos;t do that -- you know what , then the hell . </s>
<s> i &apos;m going to go even further , because that &apos;s my job . </s>
<s> and i want to give you that i &apos;ve been here today for my part of the jobs . </s>
<s> because ... </s>
<s> those solid waste {sg} were always great , because the dancers were professional , and they were fantastic . </s>
<s> but then , again , very rare , something special happened , one of the actors was actually supramundane . </s>
<s> and i know you know what i mean , because i know that all of you in your life have seen such a performance . </s>
<s> it was as if time were to be at a standstill and the dancers , and they didn &apos;t do anything differently than he ever done before -- 1,000 nights before . but everything brought together . </s>
<s> and all of a sudden , he didn &apos;t even go into human human . </s>
<s> it &apos;s lit up and down by the inside , and everything erhellte by a theurgy fire . </s>
<s> when something happened then , the people knew what it was . they called it in his name . </s>
<s> they put the hands together and they started singing , „ allah , allah , allah , allah , god , god , “ , “ , “ , allah . </s>
<s> that &apos;s god , you know ? </s>
<s> interesting historic fußnote : when the mohren südspanien , they brought this training with this . </s>
<s> when an artist unmögliches something in spain , something magical has done : „ allah , olé , olé , allah , admirable , admirable “ , admirable “ , admirable “ . </s>
<s> and that &apos;s great because we need this . </s>
<s> but , the tricky part , the next morning , follows the next morning when the dancers wake up and realize that it &apos;s 11 o &apos;clock on a tuesday -- and it &apos;s no longer a fünkchen from god . </s>
<s> it &apos;s merely a alternder sterblicher with schmerzenden knees , and maybe it &apos;s never going to go back to that altitude . </s>
<s> and maybe somebody ever will call god , &quot; if ..., then ... , &quot; but what does it start to do with the rest of his life ? </s>
<s> that &apos;s hard . </s>
<s> this is one of the schmerzhaftesten korrekturen of a creative life . </s>
<s> but maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be very much like pein , if you didn &apos;t like it from the beginning that the most extraordinary aspects of your existence come on . </s>
<s> if you may only believe that they &apos;re a loaded -- from a unvorstellbaren source for a select fruit period of their life that &apos;s been passed on somebody else &apos;s day , when they &apos;re done with it . </s>
<s> when we start thinking about it , it changes everything . </s>
<s> so i started thinking about this , and so i think with safety in the last few months , while i worked on the book , that &apos;s very soon what it &apos;s going to look like -- than the dangerous , scary , powerful expected orders successor of my abgefahrenen success . </s>
<s> what i need to tell myself is if i &apos;m going to go crazy about this , i &apos;m not afraid . </s>
<s> not daunted . </s>

<s> look at it right , this is today , clean kohletechnologie . </s>
<s> finally , the positive alternative set to our economic challenge and the challenge of national security . </s>
<s> america is in a crisis , the economy , the national security , the climate crisis . </s>

<s> but now there &apos;s a bold , new solution to get us out of that misslichen . </s>
<s> versorge america : fresh america with 100 percent clean electricity </s>
<s> a plan to get america back to work , to make us more secure and help prevent global warming . </s>
<s> finally , a solution that &apos;s big enough to solve our problems . </s>
<s> fresh america . find out more . </s>
<s> this is the last one . </s>
<s> it &apos;s about a neuversorgung of america . </s>
<s> one of the fastest paths , our dependence on the old , dirty fuels , that ignore our world . </s>
<s> the future is here . wind , sun and a new energy system . </s>
<s> new investments for creating jobs . </s>
<s> new-found america . it &apos;s time to accept reality . </s>
<s> there &apos;s an old african saying , &quot; if you want to be quick , leave alone . </s>
<s> if you want to go far , go together . &quot; </s>
<s> we need to go far , quickly . </s>
<s> thank you . </s>
<s> i &apos;d like to start asking you to do that over time your childhood was playing with bauklötzen . </s>
<s> while they realized how to get their hands and go zugreift , the klötze and move the klötze , they actually learned to think about it and to solve problems through understanding and change spacial dendrite [spv.] [archaic] [spatial dendrite] [ice crystal] connections . </s>
<s> the spatial thinking is narrow with how we understand most of our surroundings . </s>
<s> as scientists -- inspired by the art of our interaction with real objects -- my colleague patti and my colleague jeevan kalanithi , i started to wonder : &quot; what if we were to use computers , the instead of a digital fingerspitze on a flat arbeitsfläche -- ... what if we could intervene with two hands and do the data physically , how do we want it ? </s>
<s> this question was so affectingly that we were going to be able to be able to explore the answer . </s>
<s> in a second , a siftable is an interactive computer in the size of a kekses . </s>
<s> you can move with your hand , you can perceive each other , you can figure out your movement , you can catch your movement , you have a screen and a funkempfänger . </s>
<s> most importantly , they &apos;re physically , therefore , how do you put it by the reach of your hands and access . </s>
<s> and the siftables are an example of a new generation of manipulation of manipulation digital data . </s>
<s> and if these tools become become a physical and develop awareness for their movements , recognize each other and see the subtleties of our umgangs with them , then we can start to explore research and enjoyable companion interaktionsarten . </s>
<s> let me start with some simple examples . </s>
<s> this siftable is for the videowiedergabe configured , and when i put it in a direction , the video will be played forward ; if i put it in the other direction , it &apos;s backwards . </s>
<s> and these interactive portraits take each other true . </s>
<s> so if i put you next side , that &apos;s what you &apos;re interested in . </s>
<s> if they &apos;re surrounded they &apos;re surrounded , notice they &apos;re going to be nervous . </s>
<s> and they &apos;re also feeling their motions and neigung . </s>
<s> so an interesting episode of the interactions that we began to realize was that we could use everyday gestures on data , like about farben the way that they do with liquids . </s>
<s> in this case , we &apos;ve got three siftables out as farbtöpfe configured , and i can use them to pour paint in the middle , where they will be mixed . </s>
<s> if we pass it , we can zurückschütten a little bit . </s>
<s> also , there &apos;s also some nice opportunities in education like languages , math or logikspiele , where we give people the possibility of fast trial and want to see the results . </s>
<s> this is me -- this is a fibonacci series that i do with a simple gleichungsprogramm . </s>
<s> this is a game with words , which is a kind of mixture of scrabble and boggle . </s>
<s> basically , you get every round of round on each of these siftable assigned time of departure <ATD> letters , and while you &apos;re trying to make words , you &apos;re going to audited this over a dictionary . </s>
<s> then , after about 30 seconds , you get mixed , and you have a new buchstabenkombination and new opportunities . </s>
<s> thank you . </s>
<s> these are some of the children who came up with a trip to the media lab , and i could move it to try and try and get a video of it . </s>
<s> they really loved it . </s>
<s> an interesting fact with this kind of application is that you don &apos;t have to give people a lot of instructions . </s>
<s> all you have to say about is words &apos; words , and you know exactly what to do . </s>
<s> so here &apos;s some people that are testing it . </s>
<s> this is our youngest beta-tester there on the bottom right . </s>
<s> it turned out that he was going to put the siftables . </s>
<s> so for him , they were only if ... . </s>
<s> this is an interactive trickfilmanwendung . </s>
<s> we wanted to develop a lernmittel for sprachlerner . </s>
<s> this is felix . </s>
<s> he can bring new characters into the scene using the siftable conscience-stricken from the table that shows this character . </s>
<s> this is where he lässt the sun . </s>
<s> the sun goes on . </s>
<s> now , he &apos;s taking a tractor in the scene . </s>
<s> the orange traktor . </s>
<s> good work ! yes ! </s>
<s> by shaking the siftables and put it next to each other , he can interact with the characters ... </s>
<s> ... his own story . </s>
<s> hello ! </s>
<s> it &apos;s a story of open ends , and he can decide how they evolved . </s>
<s> flying cat . </s>
<s> the last example that i &apos;ve been able to show you today is a musik-sequencer for live-auftritte that we &apos;ve been developing recently , and in the siftables , like führungsstimme , utterly amazed and drums . </s>
<s> each has four different variations ; you can choose what you want to use . </s>
<s> and you can put those sounds into the sequence that you can associate in any kind of pattern . </s>
<s> and you speist it by simply holding a ton-siftable to uphold the old-fashioned structure . </s>
<s> there are effects you can change live , such as hall and filters . </s>
<s> you put it with a particular tone and then it tends to to position . </s>
<s> and then even more dramatic effects like speed and volume that are taking us all over the sequence . </s>
<s> so let &apos;s see . </s>
<s> we &apos;re beginning to put the führungsstimme in two sequenz-siftable to feed in and put them in a row , expand them and add a little more of the voice . </s>
<s> now i &apos;m going to add an utterly amazed . </s>
<s> now i &apos;m going to do something else . </s>
<s> and now i &apos;m setting the filter with the drums , so that i can control the effect live . </s>
<s> i can go the whole sequence by looking at the pace of one or another direction . </s>
<s> and i &apos;m now setting up the filter with the bass , for some more expression . </s>
<s> i can close the sequence in the process . </s>
<s> so , i don &apos;t have to plan with it , but i can improvise it , or to abbreviate it or to abbreviate it . </s>
<s> and finally , i can to blank out the whole sequence by running the lautstärke-siftable to the left . </s>
<s> thank you . </s>
<s> so , as you can see , my excitement to develop new mensch-computer-schnittstellen that will be better to what our brains and bodies work . </s>
<s> and today , i had time to show you a part of this new design-welt and some of the possibilities of what we &apos;re working on in our lab . </s>
<s> the idea that i want you to do on the path is that we are at the verge to this new generation of werzeugen to interaction with digital media , the information of the world that we have our demands . </s>
<s> thank you . </s>
<s> i &apos;m looking forward to you all talking with you . </s>
<s> yeah , good afternoon . </s>
<s> and i &apos;m happy that i am there . </s>
<s> yeah , so , what to be biohacking ? </s>
<s> i &apos;ve got to step on this a little step on this , and that &apos;s what biohacking are doing with the modern biological biology . </s>
<s> and i study molecular biology and i &apos;ve been studying molecular biology for a few years now , and that &apos;s what i started , because i wanted to go deeper and understand , because i wanted to make a lot of what i learned about . </s>
<s> so , that was my primary motivation . </s>
<s> so it was a curiosity , and i wanted to get closer to the matter , like this . </s>
<s> now , i think that biological biology is common now , which is generally speaking , biotechnology , all of which you count , synthetic biology and so on . </s>
<s> it &apos;s extremely important now , it &apos;s already very important and much , much more important . </s>
<s> and that &apos;s where it &apos;s controversial point things like these all sorts of genetic plants that are changing plants . </s>
<s> there are craig venter now in the u.s.a who tried to make biofuel , so gas from algae . </s>
<s> and there are also things that are totally in the world &apos;s everyday life , which most people are not aware of , for example , for example that allow us to wash 40 degrees of paper , we &apos;re also genetically optimierte enzymes . </s>
<s> and the list , you can continue extinct . </s>
<s> and so , from the interest of this technology , i &apos;m just going to go further . </s>
<s> so what &apos;s going on now ? </s>
<s> most people know this from the softwarebereich . </s>
<s> computers to chip , and then it will always be the media , yes , the hackers will break up somewhere and so forth data and so on . </s>
<s> it &apos;s kind of to be very sad , because that &apos;s not what it actually started like , what it actually started like this , and what it is behind . </s>
<s> and that &apos;s what the software-hacker , in the 1970s , started with computerbasteln , and that &apos;s what the internet started . </s>
<s> and it &apos;s about a playful , creative , original way of solving a problem . </s>
<s> and the problem , this is not just a technical problem , it can also be a social problem , it can be a kind of problemstellung thing , the way we simplify things like things to simplify a question , a question , a question , and how to do this better or how to make it better . </s>
<s> and it &apos;s got to stop it with software , but there &apos;s also a whole bastlerszene , and there &apos;s also a whole bastlerszene that can do all kinds of abgefahrenen things . </s>
<s> and now , even right towards biology , and there &apos;s this metaphor that comes from synthetic biology , which is that biology is an abstract code , which is , it &apos;s not very much like computers , because it &apos;s a dynamic code , because it &apos;s dynamic , because it &apos;s a matter of matter , because it &apos;s a matter of matter , and it &apos;s
<s> but it &apos;s also a code , and it &apos;s also able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to buy it , so , and that &apos;s what i found incredibly fascinating , and there i just wanted to get a lot deeper with me . </s>
<s> this actually has taken two thousand eight really , really thought these networks . </s>
<s> there &apos;s hackteria dot org , which is originally from switzerland , which is with europe and with cooperation in india in india , but now members or active people around the world . </s>
<s> this has got a lot of art , so there &apos;s a lot of artists and philosophers , and in collaboration with scientists , with these technologies to come together and ask questions with these technologies and ask the creative questions , and there are all kinds of things . </s>
<s> but it &apos;s really always about trying to find such a lockeren access to this . </s>
<s> and then there &apos;s do-it-yourself-bio dot org , d.i.y.bio . </s>
<s> this is from the u.s.a network , which is kind of like a forum , where where you might hold forward and talk online . </s>
<s> these are a little bit of technical justified , and also a little bit of businessmäßiger along the way , and then they &apos;re asking applied building technology questions . </s>
<s> and starting from those networks that have made the great popular , it &apos;s going to have evolved like a scene that i want to to portray for a moment . </s>
<s> on the top there , you see biocurious , which is a hackerspace , so basically a kind of school , so a private school , not-for-profit public company company , where everybody can be . </s>
<s> kids , old , all kinds of people go there to just fill out what they put in a lab , and look at what they can do when they do that . </s>
<s> this is a group down there in indonesia , called house-of-natural-fibers , who , however , are very long . </s>
<s> even more than those other networks . </s>
<s> they &apos;re also involved in such an artistic aspect of biological materials and , yes , elektronikbasteleien , and combine it in a very abgefahre way . </s>
<s> a group of ankara that i met a little while ago , that &apos;s what they like to do , which is that they wanted to to act as a broker the public , what they learn to learn in school , and they tried to do so on straßenfesten small action and help people explain what d.n.a is . </s>
<s> and i joined a lecture on the other picture in copenhagen at the medical museum in combination to a show to the subject . </s>
<s> and that &apos;s because it &apos;s very , very young people , but the only thing that everybody shared is this fascination in the technology . </s>
<s> and what you can do with it , and also very appropriate to society , is to be able to zuzugehen and ask , so , okay , what do you want to do with you , do you have any interest in giving you so much ? </s>
<s> so , o.k , to make up in biology now , you really need material . </s>
<s> you need , of course , biological materials , and you need tools too , and this is a lab . </s>
<s> but what you &apos;re looking at is what you usually understand from a lab , these are kind of worn rails machines , extremely expensive , extremely aloof , just for fachpersonal , trained academics with doktortitel and so on . </s>
<s> and our approach was to say , &quot; o.k , you don &apos;t really need to do that . </s>
<s> this is not necessary , because each one of every kaffeeautomat has actually higher technology than most laborgeräte , which is really the way . </s>
<s> and he &apos;s in love with this premise with this premise , after brian degger in england , tried a minimallabor zusammenzustellen , so he tried to take a dampfdruckkochtopf , a heizplatte and , yes , so suppenbrühe , and then bred bacteria . </s>
<s> so anyone who has a soup that has a soup that has made it too long , it &apos;s done . </s>
<s> and i tried that in my lab home , a little bit of reputation , and then put it so second-hand-equipment on ebay and put it in a little bit of d.n.a analysis , tried a vaterschaftstest , so / d.n.a fingerprinting , at home . </s>
<s> this really shouldn &apos;t be a joke , actually . </s>
<s> in the bottom here , you can see this lab , in anführungsstrichen , so that &apos;s a zugestellte garage with so much laborgerümpel that he has in paris , which has been in the place , which has been set up , and it &apos;s pretty successful to do , and also quite interesting things , and also , i want to give up a project . </s>
<s> and this is biocurious , who just mentioned hackerspace , this one , that &apos;s kind of volkshochschule in principle to molecular biology . </s>
<s> and yes , you can see , it &apos;s relatively relatively well , so this is very close to people who are doing it by their own , to so far , to the to be good entertainment value , the of substantial length organizations that are willing to do more invalid [formally wrong] in institutionalisierter forms . </s>
<s> but always the approach is that it &apos;s going to be easy and accessible . </s>
<s> the first project we did as international groups , when we were sort of aware of ourselves , o.k , but we &apos;re now here as a real scene right now , and we &apos;re online , and we know about the people who are always practicing and so on . </s>
<s> and then just came from the do-it-yourself-bio org website &apos;s website , and i said o.k , we &apos;ve got to really make a lot of things that we &apos;ve been making , and then has two things together , one in london , two thousand 10 , and shortly to the u.s.a , san francisco . </s>
<s> and then , it turns out , yes , nay  [literary] , who are we , what we want , what do we want , what do we want to say ? </s>
<s> what are our values and what are our values , what are our intent ? </s>
<s> and that &apos;s where we broke an code-of-conduct . </s>
<s> this was quite intuitive , so everybody just got your desires , his , and what was going on , expressed it . </s>
<s> and there , i think , was doing some good code . </s>
<s> and so that &apos;s not allying , but that &apos;s what i think is very good , i think , well , you &apos;ve done pretty well , people are quite convinced by this . </s>
<s> and we even tried to put it back into the academic world , but it &apos;s not that kind of unincorporated . </s>
<s> so i think that we are in the process of biohackerszene , in fact , a step further than the academic world . </s>
<s> so what kind of do we do ? </s>
<s> one project i did with the hackteria-netzwerk in switzerland , was that we wanted to make an optical trap or optical pinzette . </s>
<s> this is when you go to a beam beam , in the room , then you can put little particles in the air or in the liquid , and then move in the liquid , and then move in this focus , so it &apos;s captured like such a traktorbeamstrahl . </s>
<s> it really works like this is going to work in the academic setting , and we thought , o.k , we might be able to get back to a webcam , the unscrewed [jar, etc.] , the lens , the lens , reverse , then you get a microscope that adds up with something like amplified . </s>
<s> you can see that down there . </s>
<s> and then we got a d.v.d , brenner brenner , and then we tried to rausgeholt the laser and then tried to focus on this camera . </s>
<s> and unfortunately , it didn &apos;t work out , but we &apos;ve learned a lot about it . </s>
<s> so , another project that was made out of the french group that was in paris , this has been very cool . </s>
<s> and that &apos;s what he got like , kind of like a hirnwellenmessgerät , so e.e.g , or something like that , so he &apos;s engaged with neurobiologie , his nickname is sam neurohack . </s>
<s> he then made this helmet in there , and he was in cooperation with the museum , and in cooperation . </s>
<s> and then the visitors in the room could go in the room , put in this chair . </s>
<s> and then their brainwaves were measured , and depending on what they thought or how they thought , they &apos;re different lights in the room . </s>
<s> was quite a pretty becoming dress project . </s>
<s> another thing from the united states , and that &apos;s what the vaterschaftstestgeschichte has to do with these vaterschaftstestgeschichte , which is the p.c.r , that &apos;s the polymerase-kettenreaktion , complicated word . </s>
<s> so it &apos;s about copying genes to to accrete , d.n.a , fragmente , fragmente , so you can see them . </s>
<s> so now , if i &apos;m going to do this , you go to the profiler , you go to the , collect some haarproben , and then you do these kind of haarproben , and then you can say , o.k , that hair , that hair , is that guy . </s>
<s> and the machines that make things like this are very expensive to buy the very expensive , the ones that you buy commercial , which are the cheapest ones to go on at the four thousand euro . </s>
<s> and that &apos;s not the case of the hobbybereich , but it &apos;s a really cool technology , which is also very much . </s>
<s> so this is just an application of a lot that you can do with it . </s>
<s> and they &apos;ve got two bastler rangesetzt , and they say , well , we make it easier and cheaper , and then we have the open source of open source so free , so free to this device , elektroniksachen , elektroniksachen , so that this device zusammengebastelt , and are now able to get out of these devices around the world . </s>
<s> i think that &apos;s kind of 600 dollars or something like that . </s>
<s> but anyway , it &apos;s still not cheap now , but it &apos;s in any case in a frame where it &apos;s going to be greatly available . </s>
<s> so , i think it &apos;s a very coup hack . </s>
<s> this is a project i started recently , was building a gene-gun . </s>
<s> gene-gun is , yeah , such a kind of luftdruckpistole , they &apos;re going to start something like this , two centimeters or so . </s>
<s> you put d.n.a on goldpartikel , and the goldpartikel then go into these luftdruckpistole , and then i went on to to hurt [to feel bodily pain] , and then they took that like this . </s>
<s> so the device that you see there , that doesn &apos;t work . </s>
<s> but that &apos;s my kind of prototype , but it &apos;s my research , but it looked like this kind of ast , looking at this thing , looking for electronics on it and druck it , and that was the pressure , the pressure was broken . </s>
<s> and then i took an sahnespender and set it up . </s>
<s> a sahnespender , if you make the full power with water , it has enough pressure , so i think 40 to six times at the end of it . </s>
<s> and then you can go up with the particles that are very expensive and then go into the front line . </s>
<s> and the commercial device costs about fünfzehntausend dollars , or something like this , sahnespender around 50 . </s>
<s> so it &apos;s not the same efficiency , but it &apos;s essentially achievable . </s>
<s> so , at the moment , the kernanliegen of the scene is to increase this availability of technology and also to expand the information and the verständlichkeit to expand that more people can engage . </s>
<s> because , as the beginning said , it &apos;s an extremely important technology , and most people have relatively little idea of it , and also no chance to get out of there . </s>
<s> because , if you read about it , from sekundärliteratur , that &apos;s not the same thing as if you did it yourself . </s>
<s> and i think technology is becoming more important in our modern societies . </s>
<s> and if you want to make good citizens in society as well , if you want to have good decisions in society , you want to be able to join them , then you need to have access to knowledge and technology . </s>
<s> and you have to do it and understand it and understand it and understand . </s>
<s> and then , you know , that &apos;s firmiert to be an also-ran and citizen science . </s>
<s> so , you know , as citizens is going to be able to take you into your citizens , your scientific technologies are auseinanderzusetzen . </s>
<s> and this is the kernanliegen from biohackern . </s>
<s> these are the people who booked at least officially , on the website , d.i.y.bio-dot-org website . </s>
<s> this is a rather remarkable number of people around the world . </s>
<s> and what &apos;s interesting also is that they are represented in southeast asia . </s>
<s> that &apos;s what i think there are fewer people writing than there are actually less people . </s>
<s> so i know some who didn &apos;t booked up . </s>
<s> and these are just the biohacker ones , the individual people . </s>
<s> also , partly with these hackerspaces , these places , they put together . </s>
<s> and this is the beginning . </s>
<s> as i said , zweitausendacht did not start . </s>
<s> and hackerspaces , so the computerhackerspaces , the computerhackerspaces , was the first , neunzehnhundertfünfundneunzig . </s>
<s> and this is now a gigantic network of very good , yes , infrastrukturzentren , that are represented all over the world . </s>
<s> and we hope of course , of course , we &apos;re going to go too much like we then to diffuse and then be a lot of to blend in well (with sth.) , so that might be able to be involved with people . </s>
<s> and i would invite everybody to deal with it and even try and explore . </s>
<s> it &apos;s not that simple now , but it &apos;s not something that can &apos;t be possible if you &apos;ve got enough curiosity and enough energy , then you get far . </s>
<s> thank you for listening . </s>
<s> that &apos;s it . </s>
<s> yes , hey . </s>
<s> how do we actually do human beings ? </s>
<s> this is a question that drives me very moving as a designer , but also in the forschungsbereich usability and most of all things in the world . </s>
<s> it &apos;s about how to look at people in an interactive media so that they can use these interactive media , and then create them to create an interactive experience . </s>
<s> and what i think is that the interactive media in us is to archaise [Br.] , cognitive models , so paradigm that we &apos;ve been einprogrammiert in our biological memory very , very long time , and that we can only get those right through interactive media . </s>
<s> and that &apos;s really amazing , because this is the fact that these hochtechnologie that you get to notice that this is the hochtechnologie that actually brings it into the future , but in fact , the future is right with us , in our archaischen roots . </s>
<s> what are actually to archaise [Br.] models now ? </s>
<s> so i &apos;ve got to write four stichworte and want to explain quickly . </s>
<s> so , to archaischen cognitive models , and that &apos;s the models that we &apos;ve observed in the pre-industrial times . </s>
<s> we &apos;ve heard about these archaischen models that we have an practically natural relationship with virtuality . </s>
<s> basically this sounds unusual . </s>
<s> but i &apos;m going to go back to that in the same way , and then prove that they have a natural relationship with virtuality . </s>
<s> the second part is that we &apos;ve been able to talk about this archaischen models that are very , very difficult to speak to very , very , very . </s>
<s> and the third area , which is actually explaining by itself . </s>
<s> we all know that the interactive media is nonlinear by definition , which contains the denial of the linearity , which of course says that we feel the right as normal . </s>
<s> the fourth thing is that the story for us is a place of informationsweitergabe . </s>
<s> now , that &apos;s now with the virtuality , which is actually the most natural thing in the world . </s>
<s> i &apos;d like to prove that . </s>
<s> how many doors did the house that they live in ? </s>
<s> this is what we won &apos;t be able to do spontaneously , but it &apos;s going to happen , and it &apos;s happening right now . </s>
<s> they go through this house in demn , demn , and look at how many doors are . </s>
<s> and that &apos;s what they do . </s>
<s> they &apos;re virtualisieren the reality , without computers . </s>
<s> yeah , right ? </s>
<s> and that &apos;s what we &apos;re trying to do on the medien-campus for example of the virtual reality in our v.r.-labor , so we can actually do this all the time . </s>
<s> and this fortune , the virtual african , the virtual sciences had to have the realität of the reality , which people didn &apos;t need to have a acerbic , because they had nothing . </s>
<s> they didn &apos;t have books . </s>
<s> or they didn &apos;t have any fotolitografie . </s>
<s> they had no media policy . </s>
<s> the only thing they had was her head . </s>
<s> and the memory was played in that head . </s>
<s> in this head , knowledge called knowledge and using these virtual images , the imagination , has been on the other way . </s>
<s> and that &apos;s why it &apos;s so powerful to us that we can deal with virtuality so well . </s>
<s> the interesting thing about this is , if i can do a little trip . </s>
<s> yeah , that &apos;s happening . </s>
<s> the interesting thing is that , at that time , it was medienproduzent and medium itself . </s>
<s> now , if you keep thinking a little bit of thinking . </s>
<s> what are media ? </s>
<s> then you &apos;ll notice that it has given us a change . </s>
<s> but that &apos;s what i &apos;m getting to speak . </s>
<s> central tools of informationsvermittlung have been stories . </s>
<s> schamanen , priests , so-called wissenswächter , were to have extra off to keep knowledge in stories . </s>
<s> and even today , we rely very , very strong in stories . </s>
<s> the author of the book called the storytelling animal forensics , jonathan gottschall , we still according to sb./sth. hours of eintausendneunhundert hours every year . </s>
<s> this means for a kid that has spent it to the rise of the großjährigkeit most of the time of his life with the rezeption of stories . </s>
<s> now we think our love to stories is that we &apos;ve been sitting on the lap of our parents . </s>
<s> no , no , not very been absent . </s>
<s> this goes way back to the cultures of space-time times . </s>
<s> but for me , in the technological media , as a very impressive thing to myself , is that , by sales in our biological memories , we have discovered the ability to think of . </s>
<s> i gave you an example from the north american tribe . </s>
<s> and life lived in the küstenregion of british columbia . </s>
<s> and as you can see , it &apos;s a very inselreiches area , and you had to navigate , to sort of navigate , from the island to an island to get food . </s>
<s> and they did that with something called lead-landkarten lead-landkarten . </s>
<s> you might be familiar with this before , if you &apos;re interested in a little bit of the australian ureinwohnern . </s>
<s> they have similar principles . </s>
<s> they don &apos;t have any lead-landkarten , but they &apos;ve used the gennanten songlines , or traumpfade . </s>
<s> and what &apos;s really interesting about this is that the navigation and the topography of regions could be detected in songs . </s>
<s> which was the language of accessory [lower-ranking] rang . </s>
<s> that means you &apos;re talking about sound and about rhythm . </s>
<s> and this sounds and this rhythm , the geology , has shown the topography of a region , and it also allows that you could to defragment these songs and put it in different places like this to turn to the left , to be able to go back to the right , and to move to the right . </s>
<s> why don &apos;t we sing that from top from a to b ? </s>
<s> however , not to navigate . </s>
<s> what actually happened ? </s>
<s> what happens is this is what &apos;s so powerful . </s>
<s> we have moved ourselves in the so-called vogt-zeitalter . </s>
<s> what &apos;s happened is the fake , and then the book happens , and it &apos;s happened to be the fotolitografie . </s>
<s> and that is what happens is that we changed the responsibility for our memories and their own production of our individual memories on external media . </s>
<s> on the book and the picture . </s>
<s> so , unfortunately , we would mention god a piece of unlearnt . </s>
<s> virtuality has become strange for us , and it has nothing to do with reality . </s>
<s> bruce brown , a well-known designforscher on the brighton-university , is so far to say that these media , he means the book and so on and so forth as media , so on and so on and so forth as media today , that the media of our memories have been emitted and our ability to virtualisieren our capacity . </s>
<s> let &apos;s make a little zwischenbilanz . </s>
<s> from the vogt-zeitalter to the maschinenzeitalter machine . </s>
<s> what does it have to do on our thinking and our erinnerungsvermögen ? </s>
<s> and then you have the verblassenden influence of the pre-industrial cultures . </s>
<s> and they &apos;re going to be able to be more boring than difficult over the centuries over the centuries , and more than that . </s>
<s> that means instead of trying to remind us that we have standardized , far , vast , vast areas of memories that we can depend with our personal memories . </s>
<s> we &apos;re not producing ourselves . </s>
<s> we have an abstract language . </s>
<s> we don &apos;t think of this thing in pictures that are not in pictures anymore anymore , but we to codify them to our language . </s>
<s> we &apos;ve been able to make things linear . </s>
<s> and we &apos;ve accepted the linearity as law , and there &apos;s only no exceptions , like by way of example . </s>
<s> what it has remained with us is storytelling . </s>
<s> and yet we &apos;re still very , very arrested with storytelling as informationsvermittlung . </s>
<s> the question is , what &apos;s going on now ? </s>
<s> we had the vogt -zeitalter , we had the maschinenzeitalter , and we now put that so-called what &apos;s called cyber-zeitalter . </s>
<s> it sounds very spacig and listening to science , i know . </s>
<s> but these concepts of cyber-zeitalters , that allows us to explore these opportunities again . </s>
<s> it &apos;s about virtuality , it &apos;s about non-linearität , it &apos;s about storytelling . </s>
<s> i want to explain this a quickly . </s>
<s> so there are technical concepts like the augmented reality , which means the extended reality . </s>
<s> so if you look at google glasses for example , then it &apos;s a concept of what the virtual world can combine with the real world , which means our affinität to virtualisierung , the virtual african as something ordinary , natural . </s>
<s> another example is the so-called virtual reality . </s>
<s> so that &apos;s kind of crazy , of course , in the context of my talk , because we don &apos;t really move to the existenten , virtual worlds , in a way of holodecks . </s>
<s> and other examples are the most powerful , intelligent systems . </s>
<s> these are spaces that can respond to a human being . </s>
<s> all of this is the ability to get our basic ability to accept virtuality as a real habitat . </s>
<s> i &apos;m in the conclusion , and i &apos;m hoping that the video works , a very , very nice project , that &apos;s the bachelorarbeit from michael burk , ann-kathrin krenz , joris klause and jan-moritz müller . </s>
<s> and the two letzteren are here today . </s>
<s> maybe you get up for a second , so you can talk to each time with the two of the project . </s>
<s> and i brought this project as an example , and again , like again , this archaischen , cognitive models . </s>
<s> this is a game i have to say . </s>
<s> which of course , of course , is extremely entgegenkommt , and it &apos;s a computer game . </s>
<s> and when i say to computer games , they probably have a lot of eyes in the eyes that any people were looking at each other konsolen herumhappeln , or that they were playing with one of the konsole in their hand . </s>
<s> in case they do that . </s>
<s> this is a game for out . </s>
<s> and that &apos;s kind of thinking that i discover the outside world , so i rediscover the real world . </s>
<s> and this game connects the virtual world , which is the data that we produce with the real world . </s>
<s> and i &apos;m sorry that i need to bite so much . </s>
<s> you can explain it the same way much better , there &apos;s more , more behind it . </s>
<s> and it &apos;s about a city to discover a city by looking at what &apos;s positive or negative getwittert . </s>
<s> and so , i get from the town in a totally different sight , a very different impression , which is a very different impression , and i see negative and positive zones of a city and getting a whole , virtual map from a very real city . </s>
<s> and we can look at that now . </s>
<s> ah , what you can see here , sorry , is a little explanation of what you see in the same way . </s>
<s> of course , these virtual world lives in the walls of our cities , that &apos;s clearly clear . </s>
<s> and with a kind of a flashlight , we can detect these virtual worlds . </s>
<s> so , i &apos;d like to put this back to my talk and the skill that we &apos;ve acquired from the vogt -zeitalter , and that the characteristics that we &apos;ve acquired from the vogt -zeitalter , and that we can be activated in this way with complex , technological technology , new products actually not in the future , but actually to us back to our roots . </s>
<s> thank you . </s>
<s> yeah , i &apos;m really excited to be able to be with you . </s>
<s> i &apos;ve been asked if this bag is a aptonym [spv.] bag , and i &apos;m talking about it . </s>
<s> it &apos;s not going to be done . </s>
<s> i &apos;m also going to leave what &apos;s inside there . </s>
<s> but in fact , i still do it a little bit curious about it . </s>
<s> yes , kids are of nature and should be curious , designers too . </s>
<s> i &apos;m gestalter from my house , so of course i &apos;m also dealing with the respect of curiosity and how the curiosity changes the curiosity again , and why we may lose our curiosity , and why we &apos;re going to have to be curiosity and so forth again . </s>
<s> this is a whole range of things that you think of as your voices . </s>
<s> when professors are kind of curious , then they &apos;re abundant reingeschoben . </s>
<s> and this is also what i had half a year . </s>
<s> a forschungssemester to the subject of natural user interface interface . </s>
<s> now , you &apos;re going to ask yourself , why are all of these rules to go with such natural , archaischen urformen of communication , interaction and so forth . </s>
<s> and there &apos;s only one out of these small devices , because things should always be more intuitive , more and more natural , more benutzungsfreundlicher , and then you need to look at what is , of course , humans , what &apos;s benutzungsfreundlich or intuitively . </s>
<s> and in front of the background , i &apos;ve been able to design the natural user user interface , which is the next generation in human computers in the process of human computers with the process of our tools or how to change computers from the computer to digital assistant . </s>
<s> so i was looking at it , when was of course , of course . </s>
<s> maybe again , just have to look behind behind this . </s>
<s> why does that even happen ? </s>
<s> so if we look at the development of our society , this is a moment ago , we move from the third to the fourth gesellschaftsgeneration or gesellschaftsform . </s>
<s> so , from the modern , in upper-class circles . </s>
<s> every society is coined by a primärmedium . </s>
<s> at the beginning , stammesgesellschaft started through language . </s>
<s> that means that you &apos;ve found a common language , so you &apos;ve been talking to each other , you went into the same cave , you could communicate in other areas , cities has been moved in the same cave , or in other parts , cities have been able to make cities . </s>
<s> but the primärmedium was the language of something very natural , some really living . </s>
<s> you didn &apos;t have to learn from it , so you can &apos;t insult to nature , but we learn successive abolition and comparatively . </s>
<s> it was then detached by the ancient society and the first form of abstraction . </s>
<s> this was an riesen-aufschrei , because , of course , the public language began to be to demonstrate in the form of writing , which means what was fluid and alive , then i start to go on and put it in stone and manipuliere it . </s>
<s> after i go out and when i meißel , of course , it &apos;s a very different narrative than if there &apos;s a whole kind of as good as . </s>
<s> but then , successive abolition , they did that as primärmedium , that they got started . </s>
<s> and then came the next generation that we actually still live in . </s>
<s> this is just the to cleanse by burning and print geprägte script with gutenberg and others . </s>
<s> at that time , it &apos;s been a affront , where adel , klerus and other people have said , are you really surprised when the people start reading , then they want to be able to read for afterwards , and that &apos;s , of course , totally fatal . </s>
<s> and now we get to the next generation , and this is exciting , so it &apos;s just a few hundred years , and we really are at the moment in this phänomenalen phase that we get up . </s>
<s> this , of course , totally confused with us , because we &apos;re seeing on one side the new media , social social media , facebook and so on . </s>
<s> with the total transparency of transparency , what the new thinking is , what the old thinking is , what the old thinking are , and no than other phenomena , which is what i want to just to blanket [hush up] this and want to to advertise this . </s>
<s> and those two worlds are only just together , new and old thinking . </s>
<s> what &apos;s exciting about this is , if you look at the guy , this new society , these computergesellschaft , borrowed very many mechanisms , principles and archaic style paradigm from the stammesgesellschaft . </s>
<s> now , not at the local level , but on the global level . </s>
<s> we understood that the weather is global . </s>
<s> that the theme of ecology is a global global . </s>
<s> it &apos;s not when i think this local eco-unfriendly and the neighbor thinks less organic , then it doesn &apos;t work . </s>
<s> this means that , from the local village , a global village has become a global village with the same principles , of course , of course , but also the total transparency . </s>
<s> so , like you knew in the village , who has something with who and when , well , this is what happens to this expansion of our self through these mobilen endgeräte on global space . </s>
<s> is it that we know of global to accumulate and faster and better to accumulate . </s>
<s> just as it happened to be in the village . </s>
<s> in front of the background , i &apos;ve been able to look busy with this , which is what it really means to us , which is what we might be unlearnt , which is why we might be behaviorally of , what &apos;s the difference ? </s>
<s> because what often happens is , you can &apos;t do that , you can &apos;t benutzungsfreundlich it . </s>
<s> so you have to deal with what it means because it &apos;s , and not just to change it , it &apos;s different , it &apos;s supposed to be better . </s>
<s> and when , of course , it &apos;s a little intuitive , and how can i make an advantage of it as a designer , and the same thing about the things that are going to make a benutzungsfreundlich , so far intuitively , because then they &apos;re fun and they &apos;re easy to use . </s>
<s> you &apos;re looking at it , also during the degree of perception and wahrnehmungspsychologie . </s>
<s> and , of course , that &apos;s what you &apos;re starting to start and say , &quot; okay , i &apos;ll just look into the inner self . </s>
<s> and what &apos;s going on in there ? </s>
<s> so how do we work when we reingucken ? </s>
<s> so , of course , what does , of course , intuitively and how our channels of perception and how does it work ? </s>
<s> because steve jobs told you , you know , you know , steve jobs to dig up on your understand to the understand . </s>
<s> so you really have to go in the detail , if i want to do something that &apos;s benutzungsfreundlich or intuitive , which means that in the core . </s>
<s> and what you &apos;ll see here is that you &apos;re going to be a one of our seven senses , most people think it &apos;s only about five , but it &apos;s probably very , very soon , the next to the next , eighth sense , and as an erweiterung , again , again . </s>
<s> and look , how do we process information , how do we make information ? </s>
<s> to say , well , what &apos;s information ? </s>
<s> information is the difference of a difference . </s>
<s> a lot of them use the word , don &apos;t know what it means then . </s>
<s> but what i have to understand in the core is when information &apos;s going to understand information , when will information be able to do information from data and from information that i know , so i know how to do some kind of intuitive or something . </s>
<s> and , of course , how design affects perception . </s>
<s> we &apos;re seeing this when i &apos;m designing things , and then i can make them confusing what i don &apos;t know , where i don &apos;t know what &apos;s salt and pepper , or i can make them some kind of intuitive way of showing things . </s>
<s> so a lot of natural ones , in one hand , but i look straight , where i look at where &apos;s salt and pepper . </s>
<s> and when i say someone , you give me salt or pepper , then it will look at the right stage , where is inside . </s>
<s> and then , at the left , it &apos;s to catch hold of and i hope that no sugar is in there , the salt actually gives out . </s>
<s> but also our perception of ourselves , how scary it is . </s>
<s> for example , that perception in context . </s>
<s> and the right circle looks taller than the little ones , although that &apos;s not the case at all , but they &apos;re equally the same size , and yet we &apos;re changing our perception depending on what context we are doing things . </s>
<s> does anybody know what that is ? </s>
<s> come on . </s>
<s> pattern recognition was supposed to go . </s>
<s> there &apos;s more to my pair of glasses . </s>
<s> so it &apos;s &apos; n . </s>
<s> it &apos;s beginning to start a second circle , some kind of resemblance , kind of resemblance . </s>
<s> and then , if i &apos;m going to go to another one half-oval , we don &apos;t even see any one unit , which is where circle and circle and , but we see one unit , we don &apos;t see three parts , a circle , a circle , one another . </s>
<s> this is something called gestaltgesetz , or flush (with) [level with] gestaltpsychologie , who also affects us in perception . </s>
<s> it &apos;s important for the benefit of men , the great semester , the great gestaltgesetze . </s>
<s> gestaltgesetz of the continuity and so on . </s>
<s> often in the third , forget back . </s>
<s> but that &apos;s really an important part of a lot , if you want to make things very intuitive . </s>
<s> so the next phenomenon , which is very interesting , is looking at this . </s>
<s> so it sounds perfectly fine , but it &apos;s really exciting when you get closer . </s>
<s> so we have the eyes in front , and now you think , we look at the front . </s>
<s> that &apos;s wrong . </s>
<s> they look at the back of the back . </s>
<s> which is why they projiezieren an assumption in the front of what they recognize , beispielweise circle . </s>
<s> this is the first thing we can only see our to look (at / on) before we see it back back into our seheapparat reinbringen to say okay . </s>
<s> i &apos;ve got an independent cognitive rückkoppelung , you &apos;ve got what projieziert you want . </s>
<s> and then that &apos;s where it comes back . </s>
<s> it &apos;s going to go back to the point , because the back of homely [cosy] doesn &apos;t look at the front and says , well , i &apos;m going to show you if that &apos;s what you &apos;re looking at . </s>
<s> and then it goes back to the back , and then it &apos;s actually beginning to happen . </s>
<s> so a whole , very profound way , like doing things in the same way and what are going on for millisekunden-bereichen these things . </s>
<s> i don &apos;t know who knows this picture . </s>
<s> it &apos;s exactly the same thing i described . </s>
<s> now everybody &apos;s trying to recognize this pattern . </s>
<s> i don &apos;t know who &apos;s sure . </s>
<s> does anybody see anything ? </s>
<s> dalmatiner , exactly . </s>
<s> and once i saw that that &apos;s an dalmatiner in there , you know that . </s>
<s> you &apos;ll never forget , because i &apos;m showing you where the dalmatiner is . </s>
<s> now you can see the dalmatiner . </s>
<s> and then , you always see it . </s>
<s> this is , i didn &apos;t really get any of them now , that they don &apos;t recognize any pattern of inside it / them , but i &apos;ve conditioned them in a very short way , to see this dog in this verworrenen image . </s>
<s> and this is the projection of seeing , rückkopplung , seeing . </s>
<s> now i &apos;m going to do it , and now i &apos;m projieziere to see that i see the dalmatiner . </s>
<s> i see the dalmatiner . </s>
<s> so , really exciting processes , which then , in this case , gray , gray , is not actually , but in fact , in that same kind of rosanen mass , there &apos;s so much . </s>
<s> does anybody know what three seconds are ? </s>
<s> long , yes . </s>
<s> this is our present . </s>
<s> so , it &apos;s kind of interesting to know as designers . </s>
<s> if i know something , i take three seconds , until i &apos;m kind of out of the moment into the vergangenheitsschleife , then i can also bridge the very well that i &apos;m going to get from two seconds . </s>
<s> he has to process this as a present . </s>
<s> it &apos;s going to go into the past , and so i can get very elegant wartezeiten on the computer when i know this phenomenon . </s>
<s> what does it take in milliseconds ? </s>
<s> yeah , milliseconds . </s>
<s> it &apos;s an interesting phenomenon . </s>
<s> this is where you fall in love . </s>
<s> this means , systematically , when you know this now , you &apos;re paying attention to who you look at for a long time , because i don &apos;t have a gewähr for what &apos;s going on . </s>
<s> and sixteen milliseconds , also an interesting phenomenon . </s>
<s> that &apos;s the period of most perceptions we have . </s>
<s> this is , this first impression happens in a rapidly fast speed , as we perceive things . </s>
<s> and as we see things as well , what we &apos;re looking at and how to protect ourselves against our environment so that we can think about it . </s>
<s> now , of course , the rules don &apos;t just go to the issue of perceptions and neural verarbeitungen , or kognitionsergonomie , but primarily of course with the thema issue . </s>
<s> so , how does a human deal on certain things ? </s>
<s> so , there are produktsprachlich features , so formal recognition things like that , so formal recognition things like this . </s>
<s> there are anzeichen-funktionen , where i know exactly where i need to go . </s>
<s> but also , there are symbolic features , which is why someone for such a little bit of field , which is not so much what reinpasst , so horrendous prices money of money , even though it &apos;s not so practical ? </s>
<s> we &apos;re more likely to be on the symbolischen , on the bedeutungsebene that we face ourselves as an exploit . </s>
<s> now , back to my actual topic of natural user interface and the topic , which is usability , of course . </s>
<s> usability always means , how can i possibly achieve a certain goal , or how to create a user in a particular nutzungskontext , effectively , efficient and adequate . </s>
<s> that &apos;s what the norm says . </s>
<s> how can i make something different ? </s>
<s> can i use that directly or i need to use n &apos; n , or i need an ne bis in idem [not twice for the same] training . </s>
<s> and less usable usable or benutzungsfreundlich is it . </s>
<s> i mean , that &apos;s just what i do to make and doing beautiful , doesn &apos;t mean that it &apos;s better manageable . </s>
<s> you also need to understand this . </s>
<s> and then when you look at the software that we &apos;ve been seeing , you &apos;re going to understand why ninety-nine percent of our problems are little intuitive in today &apos;s software , or not based on anhieb , the i-pad in many areas or i-phone in a lot of different areas , even though it &apos;s more intuitive than classical software . </s>
<s> it &apos;s not just an intuitive benutzbarkeit for apple to be a primary ingredient wirtschaftsfaktor , nen primary ingredient , if i &apos;d like to do the use of technological equipment . </s>
<s> why ? </s>
<s> because in the policy , we are through this new kind of nutzbarkeit , the natural user ínterfaces , for example , about five times the average on our destination . </s>
<s> you have to think that if you &apos;re going to do something of classical softrware , five hours , you need to do something like this new type of the natural software . </s>
<s> that doesn &apos;t mean that you could probably go home and go home four hours , but your employers , or of course , that it &apos;s going to go to you with the four hours . </s>
<s> but i want to say that , of course , for us , it &apos;s a very important leistungssteigerung for us to be able to make things . </s>
<s> and then , again , if we go back to the realm of software , this is the very first command crossing , driven interfaces that were very abstract , where you took months to deal with these systems . </s>
<s> and then the next one , the next one who came up with an architect biological model or mental model , like the software eergonomen , worked on this idea of something like something , the metaphor , the metaphor of a desktop to create the computer . </s>
<s> so , no longer ones and ones , or cryptic species codes , it &apos;s a metaphor . </s>
<s> so , this kind of thing has got a lot of benutzungsfreundlicher , but , of course , it &apos;s much better . </s>
<s> the next generation of graphischen benutzungsoberflächen is very much working with behavior . </s>
<s> so , i &apos;m going to make a lot more of the behavior than that . </s>
<s> this is also a paradigm paradigm . </s>
<s> that i think that this is always unwichtiger to success , just the usability of an app . </s>
<s> and if i &apos;m going to take a step weitergehe into these natural user interfaces , where i do with voice , by language , by touch , by the act of touch , by gesture and unincorporated , things don &apos;t need to drive things , then i &apos;m still faster and close . </s>
<s> but this leads to the point again , but when did things become more intuitive ? </s>
<s> when you get more intuitive , then i have to go back and see my little friend and look at my little friend and see , well , what does it mean ? </s>
<s> and that &apos;s always a lot of intuitive for us to think about , if i &apos;m going to think little about that . </s>
<s> so , apparently , he doesn &apos;t want to think about it , it &apos;s just how just comparatively do . </s>
<s> the less i kind of think about it , the more intuitive it is . </s>
<s> and what does that mean for designers ? </s>
<s> this means that if we look at the fact that we can transfer existing handlungsmodelle from one to something in something , for example , the metaphor , then i can use the record to use . </s>
<s> this is , i can just transfer an intuitive , human handlungsmodell into a piece of software , and make the software significantly benutzungsfreundlicher . </s>
<s> of course , the question of , of course , is that the intuitivste handlungsschema of our humans and now i &apos;m telling . </s>
<s> that &apos;s what we call osit-modell . </s>
<s> this uses each of us and osit is an acronym and stands for to orientate , to screen , to acquaint , transagieren . </s>
<s> this is what all of you do all the time , but it makes it unconsciously , and it &apos;s kind of behaviorally , or partially behaviorally . </s>
<s> the model is already to be announced <TBA> in the womb and it &apos;s cross-cultural , so it works around the world at young and old , and it &apos;s going to use us all the time , without that most of us knew that this model is happening . </s>
<s> osit osit turns out to about 50 to 40 times of what it is for activity , so at sleep , you realize that it &apos;s less often stressed than the day . </s>
<s> now , i can start with this mental handlungsmodell , to screen , to acquaint , transagieren assigned to a interaktionssystem . </s>
<s> and through that kind of transmission , kind of like the metaphor of desktops , it &apos;s not a metaphor of a physical object , but a metaphor of a physical object , a handlungsprinzips . </s>
<s> and this is on a higher grail of benutzungsfreundlichkeit than the transmission of a classical metaphor , which is the as a formality . </s>
<s> and as i go through this now , for example , as i &apos;m treating übersicht , to screen as choices , to screen as choices , it &apos;s big to me , i can look at my stuff in the detail , and yes , transagieren means , i can also to despatch [Br.] or shop or so on . </s>
<s> then i can put the whole . </s>
<s> i &apos;m trying to do this through a beispiels . </s>
<s> actually everybody &apos;s eaten cake . </s>
<s> overall : so i &apos;m kind of interagiere with the object , affiliable , to zoom in . </s>
<s> i get rid of all of this , can now be involved and say , show me all of this with chocolate . </s>
<s> and there &apos;s a kind of interface , which is essential , and much more natural . </s>
<s> because that i can grab the things that are able to grab up , and they can come up to me , is much more natural than if over hierarchically structured organized web web , or other mechanisms , it can make these things accessible . </s>
<s> imagination is more important than than knowledge , and with that sentence , i want to close , and i want to close with the hinweis , also designers , to think to new solutions , and in that sense , i &apos;m going to love with you for your attention and not . </s>
<s> i want to give you a very specific aspect of curiosity . </s>
<s> the first one , if you get your child as a child , is to do what ausscheidungen you &apos;ve got , right ? and depending on , if your parents has allowed you to play more or less in the töpfchen , the more , the more , the way your curiosity gets there , of course . </s>
<s> and the curiosity doesn &apos;t learn . </s>
<s> that &apos;s why all of us who are and curious about it are people who actually have an alternative that you can &apos;t learn . </s>
<s> now it &apos;s about this whole umweltdiskussion , weltuntergang , forty years , club-of-rome , club-of-rome . </s>
<s> and there &apos;s a central point about it . </s>
<s> and it depends on phosphorus . </s>
<s> give me a chance . </s>
<s> every day they give rocket scale to about two grams of phosphorus , and every day they have to pick two grams of phosphorus . </s>
<s> otherwise they can &apos;t have teeth . </s>
<s> they cannot store energy . </s>
<s> they can &apos;t have bone . </s>
<s> we could just wrap up as amorphous form mollusken . </s>
<s> in fact , if we didn &apos;t pick phosphorus and to dispense . </s>
<s> it turns out that this is what we &apos;re doing here with something , which is , in fact , what it would be really selbstverständlichkeit , but not that way . </s>
<s> because all talking about energy , but nobody talks about the phosphor-problem . </s>
<s> the phosphor-problem is much more critical . </s>
<s> we depend on two countries . </s>
<s> we only have an phosphorus for two years , and right now , through the phosphor-bergbau world , we &apos;ve got a lot more uranium in the environment than it is used in all atomanlagen . </s>
<s> in the last 20 years , fünfzehntausend tons have been infected to our fields in germany . </s>
<s> and we take that all up . </s>
<s> it makes leukemia in children . </s>
<s> and we think we would protect the environment if we are slightly less harmful . </s>
<s> so , for example , schütz the environment , get less car . </s>
<s> schütz the environment , make less waste . </s>
<s> schütz the environment , verbrauche less energy . </s>
<s> but that &apos;s no protection . </s>
<s> this is like if i said , &quot; schütz , your child , it &apos;s three rather than five times . </s>
<s> it &apos;s just a bit less devastation . </s>
<s> if we think of it from wiege to the bahre , then our entire earth will fall on once or then a friedhof . </s>
<s> that &apos;s why i think of the wiege to think about . </s>
<s> and the most important thing is to look at the ground . </s>
<s> in the soil , over 60 percent of the total world is stored . </s>
<s> right now , we &apos;re building corn and losing over 11 and 30 pounds at 30 pounds at 30 pounds per hectare . </s>
<s> that means we &apos;re losing five times more , more than new . </s>
<s> well , of course , we can look at the müllproblem . </s>
<s> and it &apos;s all packaging or content . </s>
<s> in offenbach , for example , at the hausmüll twenty percent , they were windeln . </s>
<s> and because we &apos;re getting older , they &apos;re getting bigger . </s>
<s> that &apos;s kind of everybody in the vorwindelphase . </s>
<s> yes ? </s>
<s> a baby needs about six windeln . </s>
<s> so we could do that by 10 percent , but what does it do ? </s>
<s> it &apos;s balanced in china in a second . </s>
<s> it &apos;s perfectly trivial . </s>
<s> so the question is , how do we go with these windeln ? </s>
<s> this is one of the evidence that men are not pigs . </s>
<s> let me tell you . </s>
<s> because the phosphorus is emitted by the to be on firm ground [also fig.] components . </s>
<s> over the urine . </s>
<s> yeah . </s>
<s> so you can &apos;t be pigs with men . </s>
<s> because that &apos;s what it shows with , right ? </s>
<s> traditionally , traditionally , we think in umweltdiskussion , we &apos;re too much in the world . </s>
<s> and when you get the people who are using it , if you say it would be better , that would be better , you &apos;re not going to be there , then you &apos;re going to be cormorant and hostile (to sth.) . </s>
<s> and so someone like al gore , one of our great heroes , there &apos;s nothing more wichtigeres than how to stabilize human citizens . </s>
<s> in israel , you say , if you give up a human race , you &apos;re rettest the earth . </s>
<s> here it says , the more you umbringst , the better . </s>
<s> yeah . </s>
<s> the first question is , are we really too much ? </s>
<s> if you look at the ants , the weight of the ants on earth , the ants drop about four times as we humans . </s>
<s> i could also take termites , but in the united states , nobody termiten , have seen in so far while you &apos;re vegetarian . </s>
<s> that means the ants weigh much more than us . </s>
<s> and because they work a lot harder than us , and because they live only three to six months of life , they &apos;re to be adequate in their weight , in their weight , in their weight . </s>
<s> that means we &apos;re not too much , we &apos;re too stupid , right ? </s>
<s> and what you see how far we are , what we really wanted to do and how sad we are , is that we are at all on earth , can you see that , for example , offenbach have a program , you &apos;re going to be a program , you want to be here , you &apos;re going to be climate-neutral . </s>
<s> they can be climate-neutral if they don &apos;t exist , right ? </s>
<s> the only chance . </s>
<s> have you ever seen an klimaneutralen tree ? </s>
<s> yes ? </s>
<s> one ? </s>
<s> that means our whole intelligence means that we want to be dumber  [Am.]  [coll.] as the trees , right ? </s>
<s> yes ? </s>
<s> no tree is kohlenstoffneutral . </s>
<s> don &apos;t happiness , yeah ? </s>
<s> there &apos;s no überbevölkerungsproblem in trees . </s>
<s> there are still six and six billion trees on it . </s>
<s> you &apos;ve heard of it from überbevölkerungsproblemen from trees ? </s>
<s> that means all our intelligence means that we want to be dumber  [Am.]  [coll.] as the trees . </s>
<s> and what you &apos;re looking at , even at something like demeter , the most stringent requirements bio- agriculture , doesn &apos;t allow us to go back . </s>
<s> every year we &apos;re losing so three million tons of phosphorus that need to go back in these camps . </s>
<s> and so we &apos;re too much . </s>
<s> alone . </s>
<s> that &apos;s what we feel so guilty on earth that we say it &apos;s not an bio-landbau , no bioland , no nature-et-progrès , and like all of them that allow us to go back and go back . </s>
<s> isn &apos;t sad ? </s>
<s> so we &apos;re too much . </s>
<s> it &apos;s safe to be less harmful , to be less harmful . </s>
<s> but where are we useful ? </s>
<s> we &apos;re trying to minimize our ecological footprint , but it &apos;s about having a major footprint that is useful . </s>
<s> we want to be good for society , we want to be good for the economy , but if it &apos;s about the environment , is the highest not to be there . </s>
<s> nullemissionen , yes ? </s>
<s> they can only have nullemissionen if they &apos;re not there . </s>
<s> even if they were shaking , they would have emissions . </s>
<s> so they can &apos;t solve this . </s>
<s> we can do it differently . </s>
<s> we can regain our nutrients . </s>
<s> we &apos;re doing brazil agriculture in the ways where we bring nutrients up . </s>
<s> right directly , we can zurückkriegen nutrients in that way . </s>
<s> we do this in china , for example , where we are taking the trash . </s>
<s> in china today , a nachttopf is called still honigtöpfchen , kind of , yeah ? </s>
<s> and in our western world we &apos;re always too dumb , we &apos;re getting rid . </s>
<s> this means that the western zivilisationsgeschichte turns out that the city has only taken out of it , but it never has done anything again . </s>
<s> because the cities had to grow more , because the farmers went into the cities , and the cities had to go and get away with nutrients . </s>
<s> all of the western rich is always expanding until they haven &apos;t done the infrastructure anymore , and then they &apos;re imploded . </s>
<s> yes ? </s>
<s> in china , it was different . </s>
<s> you &apos;ve done seamless civilization for five years , because you always have been able to zurückzubringen nutrients . </s>
<s> even today , if you &apos;ve invited to lunch , you would rather dinner that they &apos;re going to stay as long as they seek the toilets . </s>
<s> because it &apos;s contrary to go and pull out nutrients . </s>
<s> you got them to eat , not to nährstoffdiebstahl . </s>
<s> that means , you can see on the internet how to get nutrients back . </s>
<s> this is actually nice about it , if you do this , which is agriculture , based on a hectare of land with five people in favelas , can to earn for a farmer about eintausendfünfhundert dollars and waiting for them to grow eintausendfünfhundert and enten and enten and fish . </s>
<s> and the great thing is that , in the favelas , the verbrechensrate in the favelas , it &apos;s over ninety minutes by air percent . </s>
<s> so we don &apos;t have to control people to be more wrong . </s>
<s> we can support them to be good . </s>
<s> of course , that &apos;s high-tech-landwirtschaft , but the plants are wearing themselves . </s>
<s> the byproduct is clean water . </s>
<s> and they &apos;re designed like this , through the design that a farmer can to administer . </s>
<s> that means that &apos;s what the verbrechensraten means . </s>
<s> and none of those facilities , we &apos;ve now built over hundertfünzig over the last 20 years , none of these facilities were ever sabotaged . </s>
<s> you could to throw inside a liter of altöl , and then it would be ruined for years . </s>
<s> don &apos;t start . </s>
<s> that means we don &apos;t have to control the people , be kind of bad . </s>
<s> we can support them to be good . </s>
<s> that means we need to zurückkriegen phosphorus . </s>
<s> and by the way , if you want what you want to do , you write , in germany , the best tool of all treatment that are in frankfurt . </s>
<s> unfortunately , that &apos;s not in offenbach , but maybe you can help the frankfurtern . </s>
<s> because the frankfurter cost could be the best of an to recapture . </s>
<s> and it has to go back . </s>
<s> we &apos;re seeing that phosphorus really is critical . </s>
<s> and we &apos;ll see that it is happening . </s>
<s> now we &apos;ve been using this over three years now . </s>
<s> the dutch government explains that they &apos;re going to be the world &apos;s first country , which zurückgewinnt phosphorus . </s>
<s> but we need it all in time . </s>
<s> you know , there are two countries that are controlling by almost 70 percent of the world &apos;s population . </s>
<s> there &apos;s a bunch of waisenknaben in opec . </s>
<s> these are twenty-six countries that control 40 percent of the ölvorräte . </s>
<s> and the oil will replace us through other bodies . </s>
<s> but that phosphorus is not going to replace you . </s>
<s> it &apos;s not about making an investment a little bit bad , but it &apos;s about making something right . </s>
<s> and in fact , that &apos;s what the right thing to do . </s>
<s> that means it &apos;s about efficiency , not by efficiency . </s>
<s> now , of course , in holland , you understand that , because by holland , the land is built on flowers . </s>
<s> yes ? </s>
<s> imagine if for example , your wife &apos;s sad , if you &apos;ve got them , and you come with 50 circles . </s>
<s> perfectly inefficient . </s>
<s> but it &apos;s really effective , right ? </s>
<s> or take a lippenstift . </s>
<s> one woman in germany , eating about six komma three pounds in their lifetime . </s>
<s> along . </s>
<s> this is not science not exactly because we don &apos;t know how much weggeküsst is going to be . </s>
<s> but a lippenstift , even in that light , can i tell you , is entirely inefficient , but in fact , it &apos;s very inefficient , right ? </s>
<s> one of the things that &apos;s beautiful in life is not efficient . </s>
<s> that &apos;s not necessarily sustainable , it &apos;s efficiency . </s>
<s> asking , what &apos;s the right ? </s>
<s> it &apos;s not to burn the klärschlamm of a little bit better , and to keep it abzulagern and to lose all kinds of materials that are available , but how do you deal with it ? </s>
<s> think about mozart efficiently . </s>
<s> yes ? </s>
<s> if i einlade you to dinner and say yes , there &apos;s a pill with offenbach-geschmack and glass of water . </s>
<s> wonderful , huh ? </s>
<s> this is efficient . </s>
<s> everything that &apos;s beautiful in life is not efficient . </s>
<s> if someone fell in love with someone , efficient ? </s>
<s> yes ? </s>
<s> that means all of the things that counts in life is not to save it . </s>
<s> all the umweltdiskussion . </s>
<s> we tell people , oh , you don &apos;t have a google in the south . </s>
<s> no , it &apos;s exactly the right thing , right ? </s>
<s> in every spot where you go wegwirft , you go , you get lebensmöglichkeiten . </s>
<s> but the wrong things . </s>
<s> if you wegwirft the wrong things , you have a müllproblem . </s>
<s> we think about north . </s>
<s> there &apos;s any footprint here . </s>
<s> if you go , yeah , you lose the floor . </s>
<s> because even the soil will die of mosses and the wind and the water washing away away . </s>
<s> but if you &apos;re in italy , every footprint means that the water remains longer in the meadow . </s>
<s> so , it &apos;s about creating a major footprint that &apos;s going to be a feuchtgebiet . </s>
<s> not schuldmanagement . </s>
<s> we say in germany . </s>
<s> yes ? </s>
<s> but if i ask you , how do you do with your wife ? </s>
<s> what do you say ? </s>
<s> sustainable . </s>
<s> then i say , &quot; my commiserations (on) beileid , &quot; right ? </s>
<s> this is the minimum step up . </s>
<s> so saving , give up , avoid . </s>
<s> each waste is nährstoff . </s>
<s> and it &apos;s a lot of lust when you see in italy , like the people coming out in the old books in such a way . </s>
<s> because you know , this is a lustvoller process . </s>
<s> it &apos;s an accurate form of revierverhalten , right ? </s>
<s> you can show , i was there . </s>
<s> but with the real design , there you go . </s>
<s> for example , we &apos;ve developed an eiscremeverpackung , which is an unprecedented fluid . </s>
<s> they can to chuck out [coll.] where they go and they are . </s>
<s> they &apos;re growing everywhere in two hours . </s>
<s> and it contains seeds of rare plants so that they contribute to biodiversity . </s>
<s> that means we &apos;re useful , not less harmful . </s>
<s> so , there are two things . </s>
<s> not all of them should be compostable . </s>
<s> a television or a washing machine , they only use it , they don &apos;t use it . </s>
<s> just the things that to abrade , like schuhsolen , like autoreifen , like autoreifen , who have to be so that they go into biological systems . </s>
<s> the things that are only used are going to go into technical systems . </s>
<s> but today we &apos;re only talking about biological systems . </s>
<s> yes ? </s>
<s> for example , the sneaker , right ? </s>
<s> it &apos;s really direct advertising , it &apos;s not for the company puma by puma , but for the fact that you now help this company to make these products successful . </s>
<s> because we don &apos;t really do things more freely . </s>
<s> yes ? </s>
<s> so , if i einlade them to dinner and say , that &apos;s free of hähnchen , then it helps you do nothing . </s>
<s> no , we noticed what &apos;s inside . </s>
<s> positive . </s>
<s> so , not like detox . </s>
<s> not toxic in it . </s>
<s> it &apos;s all in it , it &apos;s useful . </s>
<s> these are the first shoes that you can do with the kavalierstart of the fußgängerampel and go the rubber to the biodegradability , right ? </s>
<s> all of it is compostable of this . </s>
<s> and if we can do it , of course , it &apos;s possible for us to adidas , for nike , for hennes and mauritz and all the textile cells . </s>
<s> and that &apos;s half all the world &apos;s most abwasserprobleme world that &apos;s created by the textile industry . </s>
<s> that &apos;s why you help them with , ask for people . </s>
<s> hey , puma , are you really serious ? </s>
<s> because these have changed twice with the vorstandsvorsitzenden . </s>
<s> and i &apos;m not sure i &apos;m really to stick with it . </s>
<s> so , help me a little bit about this . </s>
<s> but it &apos;s happening . </s>
<s> yeah . </s>
<s> this is what &apos;s been shown . </s>
<s> this is happening . </s>
<s> so , we can do things now that if they &apos;re to crater [sl.] , they can mix it . </s>
<s> technical contribution are the same way . </s>
<s> there &apos;s a direct rücknamesystem of this . </s>
<s> this is the first architectural bond , actually , to get into the circulation . </s>
<s> so again , in each store , you can zurückkriegen things . </s>
<s> if you do that , right ? </s>
<s> remember the windel again ? </s>
<s> now , at the moment , the waste . </s>
<s> all these windeln are around , near . </s>
<s> in the countries where people come to money . </s>
<s> so , there it is on the deponien , but also in the landscape , right ? </s>
<s> if we change the plastics , in the biological systems , if we change the wasserspeicher , if we change the wasserspeicher , they can be able to go back to zellulosebasis , then they can plant plants in israel or in tunisia . </s>
<s> yes ? </s>
<s> now , just if you take those windel , you to bruise , to castrate , to castrate and the powder to plant plants . </s>
<s> that &apos;s what the baby kohlenstoffpositiv for all of life , and it &apos;s from the beginning . </s>
<s> so , we &apos;re not going to be climate-neutral , we can be klimapositiv . </s>
<s> it &apos;s sort of to be de rigueur (for sb.) print print . </s>
<s> yeah , kind of . </s>
<s> yes ? </s>
<s> we can do that . </s>
<s> we can reinvent everything again . </s>
<s> i started an institute . </s>
<s> and there are lots of people working with this , and they all get engaged . </s>
<s> there &apos;s an extra club for it , cradle-to-cradle-verein , where everyone can . </s>
<s> so no more saving , give up , avoid , avoid , to stiff [sl.] [fail to tip or tip inadequately] , no schuldmanagement , but smart waste . </s>
<s> does that be curious ? </s>
<s> thank you . </s>
<s> the work of interpreten . </s>
<s> music as your language . </s>
<s> so , in the description of my talk , written that i was as interpretin , which is as übersetzerin , so in english wortsinn . </s>
<s> interpreten are the translator of the written of speaking length music . </s>
<s> you know , as a translator for word your text in another language , but also the deeper sense of words and wortzusammenhang need to understand the deeper meaning of words and wortzusammenhang , so that it doesn &apos;t make a good translation , everybody who makes it with fremdsprachen . </s>
<s> it &apos;s out of the german in english , can give more knowledge , which is when when you go to poetry or even about poetry . </s>
<s> it &apos;s very strange to laien what we do with our musiksprache . </s>
<s> as the interpretin of a musikstückes , i only thought the written . </s>
<s> you might think that the composer in the notes has exactly everything that he imagined . </s>
<s> in fact , the notes are very vague and imprecise . </s>
<s> these notes are roughly the same or imprecise , like a verbal , as well , as a verbal , as well as a verbal . </s>
<s> because in this verbalen case , the smell of flowers is not to smell from the grüns , to not hear the to purr of the windes , not to hear . </s>
<s> this means that the interpreter has to translate this ungenauen data in another , 'cause [coll.] [because] , concrete , non-verbal musiksprache . </s>
<s> today , i want to give you what i otherwise translate with , which is interpretiere , and so , even once in a verbal language . </s>
<s> so basically a translation of translation . </s>
<s> that &apos;s why i &apos;m willing to make the whole thing in german , because if i had to translate it into english , it would be equivalent to me with translation of translation . </s>
<s> so , the music , for me , works so much like the spoken language . </s>
<s> the notierten notes have the function of a writing . </s>
<s> so it &apos;s not necessarily able to read only notes and to push the keys on the piano on the piano , to push the right spot on the piano . </s>
<s> that &apos;s just the letters you &apos;ve learned to paint . </s>
<s> the point of letters you can tell if you can do that . </s>
<s> so , for example , you need music to be at least as long as for the spoken language . </s>
<s> so , there &apos;s also abstufungen , if you &apos;re learning it for the hausgebrauch , it &apos;s just passive to understand , or you can speak to be active to the music speakers . </s>
<s> the work of the building starts kind of like the theaterregisseurs . </s>
<s> after you start a piece like this , you &apos;ve got a piece of play , because you &apos;re excited , you &apos;re looking at the emergence of the composition . </s>
<s> you collect information about the piece of sekundärliteratur . </s>
<s> you &apos;re reading them in the letters , tagebüchern , notes , or whether it exists , thoughts itself . </s>
<s> you studied the works that he has written after and afterward . </s>
<s> you start to compare . </s>
<s> they &apos;re beweggründe to write it . </s>
<s> how did it feel ? </s>
<s> how were it happening , like society and politics ? </s>
<s> this all interest me . </s>
<s> you think of yourself in the time when you read contemporary images or literature . </s>
<s> but over time , you also have a rich knowledge of the composers that you &apos;re going to play on more than , and it &apos;s getting easier to go into it and feel it . </s>
<s> it &apos;s getting more to the average that you live with . </s>
<s> his purpose to write the piece is getting more and more and more to my personal purpose . </s>
<s> now , there &apos;s the notes all of the other being a correct record of the purpose of the composer , but only a framework , now i turn this framework to make purpose and meaning . </s>
<s> i &apos;m going to say to my own words , which could be written between this framework . </s>
<s> i &apos;ll play games that could be those sounds . </s>
<s> now for me and for the composers , and what you might be able to do today . </s>
<s> every tone , every phrase gives sense , because i feel it myself because it &apos;s my personal gelebten . </s>
<s> it has to be for me in here and coherent , otherwise i can convince my audience that this is my cause . </s>
<s> it &apos;s always a very happy concert , if i &apos;ve got to have the experience , the piece that i &apos;ve been doing so long in advance . </s>
<s> how do you get a happy new day over the day , although with the same rituals of life , get up , lose , food , go to work , so the same piece i can do the same thing over and over again . </s>
<s> i have become older years ago that move seasons , my pulse , my pulse is slower than the morning , it takes longer the sound coming back as home . </s>
<s> i take the breath of the audience , consciously or to sleepwalk into sth. [Br.] . </s>
<s> all of that influenced me and also influenced my experience with composition . </s>
<s> it &apos;s really wonderful when i &apos;m standing with a duo-partner on the stage , and we have the same wavelength . </s>
<s> and then the same thing happens in a good , angeregten conversation . </s>
<s> you get a new idea in it , and you &apos;ll be answering these answers with an act . </s>
<s> it &apos;s exciting , because then things we don &apos;t like and we can &apos;t do so on . </s>
<s> it &apos;s very fun to make music in that way , and you &apos;ve seen the audience as your music communicates alive . </s>
<s> so each concert is another concert . </s>
<s> i &apos;m never going to play anymore like that . </s>
<s> i can &apos;t play like that in 20 years . </s>
<s> so , i &apos;m going to get more lebenserfahrung than today now , and i &apos;m going to go on to my palette of musikklänge , much more farbnuancen , emotions and emotions today . </s>
<s> sure , i &apos;m going to have to get the axe [coll.] , i &apos;m going to have some to get the axe [coll.] . </s>
<s> have a nice model of it . </s>
<s> it was on a klavierkursus for my loved old teachers , professor jürgen ude , a well-known beethoven-spezialist , konzertpianist and friend of many years professor of musikhochschule in stuttgart . </s>
<s> unfortunately , i was much too young , so he was emeritus when i finally started studying . </s>
<s> but i was very fortunate , it was very early , very early , i had to meet it with 13 years , meet , and so i was so lucky to my high school . </s>
<s> i was 17 when i was sitting on one of his classes and played the last of the four balladen of chopin , a spätwerk . </s>
<s> he wondered what the introduction of these ballade was for me . </s>
<s> this is such an getragenes part . </s>
<s> and in my jugendlichkeit i said , expectation . </s>
<s> so he schmunzelte and was , &quot; right ? </s>
<s> this has to be altersunterschied . </s>
<s> because for me , she means memory . </s>
<s> he was over sexagenary  [rare] . </s>
<s> well , with 17 , you have dreams , but not meaningful memories . </s>
<s> now i &apos;m going to play the piece of every few years today , and every time it &apos;s changed for me , it &apos;s changed for me , although not a single note changed . </s>
<s> it &apos;s interesting every time , because again , i &apos;m reading something new . </s>
<s> an example of this from a very different area . retrofitting has painted the seerosen a gazillion times [Am.] [coll.] . </s>
<s> it &apos;s always the same garden , but it &apos;s different tageszeit , at meals light . </s>
<s> he &apos;s translated the seerosen at times , just as he saw it , looking at it in this moment . </s>
<s> his personal impressionen of the seerosen . </s>
<s> the x-malige interpretation of a piece is this comparable . </s>
<s> since now , i &apos;m also older than chopin with thirty-two years when he wrote the piece . </s>
<s> he just lived in thirty-nine years . </s>
<s> and i &apos;m important to look back into the notes , even though i mean , you can check it . </s>
<s> to keep zwiesprache , right with the composer . </s>
<s> because the notes are the only connection to him . </s>
<s> most of all , if it died . </s>
<s> now , how do you start talking about the language of music ? </s>
<s> and i said yes , you need for about roughly as long as for the spoken language . </s>
<s> a lot of times , though , is that you can only learn the notes . </s>
<s> you can learn virtually the first thing that you read before you &apos;re talking a word . </s>
<s> you learn to get the sounds on the notes on the instrument . </s>
<s> so if all of your time and the same things that are going on in time , just like it &apos;s in the notes , you get notes that sound together as music . </s>
<s> when this happens , the student gets the nächstschwierige piece . </s>
<s> there is not something going on about interpretation . </s>
<s> well , there &apos;s presto on the front , which is a fast piece . </s>
<s> lento , slowly . </s>
<s> so loud and leisezeichen , f of x <f(x)> and b , etc . </s>
<s> most of you do . </s>
<s> but even if you add those data , it &apos;s still something technical . </s>
<s> and there &apos;s always no interpretation . </s>
<s> i wonder . </s>
<s> and i wonder that you often forget something entirely elementares . </s>
<s> which is that for the music to make music on the instrument that do your musical work , you should be able to get there . </s>
<s> which is singing . </s>
<s> a kid who didn &apos;t learn this singing because they didn &apos;t have the parents put before , it won &apos;t do it either . </s>
<s> this is like at cock's crow . </s>
<s> it &apos;s necessary to have your own experience and the idea of music to make it a different kind of opportunity , so it &apos;s a tool that &apos;s going to sound . </s>
<s> people who have never been rejected , so never felt immediately with your body , as it &apos;s to make a sound . </s>
<s> it &apos;s to make a phrase with its own breath . </s>
<s> the computer app is an extension of our body . </s>
<s> to sing to sing , our hands and their feet to dance . </s>
<s> so the hammerköpfe in the piano are the sequel of my finger . </s>
<s> the tune comes out of the gesungenen and the rhythm from the dance . </s>
<s> the permanent disability berieselung right now is not advantageous . </s>
<s> you don &apos;t need to make yourself music if you get bored . </s>
<s> no longer need to to blast on the whistle or sing a liedchen . </s>
<s> any of your music will plattgemacht if you &apos;re constantly beschallt from the outside with music . </s>
<s> sure , there are some people who are saying , yes , but what do you do if i &apos;m not able to sing ? </s>
<s> the question i &apos;m going to ask you , if you don &apos;t know that they can &apos;t sing ? </s>
<s> or b , because they didn &apos;t learn to sing ? </s>
<s> either , it &apos;s not too late to start too late to find out whether you can &apos;t do it , or learn how to do these little muscles that are hiring the stimmbänder . </s>
<s> you can train this . </s>
<s> or c , because you attested it , they &apos;re feckless . </s>
<s> so , i ask , how did that diagnosis work ? </s>
<s> you &apos;ve got a zweit- or a drittmeinung , as you say beautiful today ? </s>
<s> or d , you might not enjoy music , and you want to do with something as well . </s>
<s> but what i would then do was regret because music is a beautiful , communicative competence thing . </s>
<s> but you might also be able to do anything else . </s>
<s> well , you can see , there must be no one to all of these cases . </s>
<s> but don &apos;t tell me , i don &apos;t get anything about classical music . </s>
<s> i can &apos;t tell if it &apos;s good or bad . </s>
<s> and i say that , but i &apos;m sure you can tell it or not . </s>
<s> because i don &apos;t think it says somebody , i don &apos;t know if it &apos;s tastes to me , because i can &apos;t cook . </s>
<s> so , you don &apos;t get to eat , just because you can &apos;t be able to be able . </s>
<s> so you don &apos;t have to get rid of classical music because you don &apos;t play any instrument . </s>
<s> hear consciously and say if they taste or not . </s>
<s> whether or not the music is too sweet . </s>
<s> tell what they &apos;re feeling . </s>
<s> over time , they get expertise , and they want to have a little bit more gewürze there , or taste even fine differences . </s>
<s> now why do i challenge from my audience that it &apos;s listening to actively ? </s>
<s> because the music is a language , and a language is to communicate . </s>
<s> a piece of art that you never see has no power . </s>
<s> the food that has been served by a text text or a chef &apos;s mind , needs to be eaten , not just looking at or viewed or rezepte . </s>
<s> so listen to you when your music is played . </s>
<s> it &apos;s not just a nice geräuschtapete . </s>
<s> if in an environment where the adults are doing music or at least natural music , a child grows , then it &apos;s very easy to ask for a musiklehrer , the color of your flower ? </s>
<s> can you play in blue now ? </s>
<s> and the kid plays , after a gedenkpause , instead of a red flower . </s>
<s> and this sounds very different than before . </s>
<s> this was the very first ever beginning of a human musical expression . </s>
<s> so the first step to an interpretation . </s>
<s> and what happens when you play a piece today that was originally a hundred years ago , before a hundred years ago , before two hundred , or may it been written by three years ago ? </s>
<s> meanwhile , the instruments have moved . </s>
<s> there was no piano at the time , as an instrument . </s>
<s> it was just not true . </s>
<s> i think the stream would be enthusiastic if he had had the klanglichen opportunities of modern klaviere . </s>
<s> now , i can tell you the klangvorstellungen that the bach has had on the modernen wing on the modern wing , which is not a barockes cembalo . </s>
<s> also from beethoven , you know that he listened to more than he &apos;s been deaf . </s>
<s> today , a modern orchestra is able to play everything that an orchestra damned damned has been . </s>
<s> that &apos;s why the composers depend on us that reinvent the bits again . </s>
<s> so they &apos;re going to break out what they presented in the mind . </s>
<s> and also , what you would think in your mind today . </s>
<s> or this , what i &apos;ve been doing today , because what you might be thinking about . </s>
<s> thank you . </s>
<s> you know what &apos;s louder ? </s>
<s> were they envious ? </s>
<s> and how did that feel ? </s>
<s> to suck at singing [Am.] [coll.] . </s>
<s> i have a friend , who drives a passerati . </s>
<s> so when i come , with my little v w piesel and meseems [poet.] me , this feeling comes on . </s>
<s> i &apos;m going to start something through your head . </s>
<s> i say , &quot; ulf , what do you need to do so much ? &quot; </s>
<s> this is what it loses for the last year half of his value . </s>
<s> and even , you work much less than i do . </s>
<s> why did i need to afford that n little car ? </s>
<s> and then immediately it falls down to me , that &apos;s unfair . </s>
<s> it &apos;s against justice . </s>
<s> and as i say the word justice , this awkward sensation is gone . </s>
<s> our organism has been invented a great way to get those kind of conceptual emotions like envy . </s>
<s> you can also help this with words like revenge or gewinnsucht or indifference . </s>
<s> i &apos;m going to explain to you today something about this mechanism or something that &apos;s probably probably familiar with you . </s>
<s> the mechanism comes out of the lie . </s>
<s> but don &apos;t think of the lying , as you might have heard , when people say that nobody has a wall to build a wall . </s>
<s> and then the rocks auftürmt so he barred them . </s>
<s> in one such lie , you see , the religious self doesn &apos;t believe what he says . </s>
<s> it &apos;s very easy to check out that it has very different in its mind . </s>
<s> it just täuscht you and not yourself . </s>
<s> no , the lie i &apos;m talking about , that has to do with doing it . </s>
<s> they need that lie to get a lebenslüge in order to get a selbsttäuschung . </s>
<s> they can do less easy , yes , to check up or einsturz . </s>
<s> they need time . </s>
<s> this time speaks an anecdote that you might be familiar with . </s>
<s> the spanish painter pablo picasso has a woman portraitiert . </s>
<s> this woman turned adversely affected , which the portrait would not even look at her . </s>
<s> picasso &apos;s just waiting . </s>
<s> it &apos;s always getting more similar . </s>
<s> at this point , and when you laugh , they recognize how important this lie is and how much time you need to learn something that artists can tell us very well . </s>
<s> because artists have a profound relationship with lying . </s>
<s> and the artist tells you something , and especially this queen , what you don &apos;t see when you just look at the mirror . </s>
<s> the artist tells you one of the main things that you &apos;re going to be familiar with when you look at this piece of work . </s>
<s> and then the awkward feeling disappears , it might just be able to see you , and it &apos;s always getting more similar . </s>
<s> so here you have this mechanism that we can use lying as a great invention for our lebensverhältnisse . </s>
<s> and it &apos;s not just in the art , also in the volksmärchen , in the mythology of the mythology , in the mythology . </s>
<s> you may be familiar with this idea of the queen who looked at the mirror every morning and asked him , who &apos;s the most beautiful most beautiful ? </s>
<s> one day , this mirror says , yes , there &apos;s a schönere . </s>
<s> behind the seven mountains and so on . </s>
<s> and they also know how much hostility from this true fit , even the mirror cannot lie , from that true auskunft . </s>
<s> but we should just make sure that you can &apos;t tell us that you can &apos;t tell you that there &apos;s a schönere somewhere else . </s>
<s> here &apos;s what it takes us to understand what we understand under politically politically correctness . </s>
<s> we need that lie that aufrechterhält us , that we can &apos;t get rid of the deception . </s>
<s> we don &apos;t just have art in the art , in the volksmärchendichtung , but also in science such as great . </s>
<s> and there &apos;s this story of the one of the bischofs of worchester . </s>
<s> she heard about this book of charles darwin , the emergence of species and the abstammung of man . </s>
<s> the people of the monkey should be to come down and , yes , a common ancestor would be between people and monkeys . </s>
<s> and then she ran her down to her husband and said , well , that &apos;s what charles writes . </s>
<s> the person &apos;s supposed to to come down or have a common ancestor . </s>
<s> no , no , that &apos;s not . </s>
<s> and if it &apos;s true , we need to stop that people will get aware of it . </s>
<s> why do we need to stop that people will get knowledge of something if it &apos;s true ? </s>
<s> because without those lebenslüge , we can &apos;t live . </s>
<s> because we are this selbsttäuschung , this sense of being great , abstammung from the highest nature , not from such an naturebene , from such an organism that exists like a organism that exists to be a brick and other things , which is unaushaltbar for us . </s>
<s> so , we can &apos;t bear these things . </s>
<s> we need to stop that the people who are concerned of things , especially when they &apos;re true . </s>
<s> so you can see how slowly this mechanism auflöst and how the traces look , which he leave on something else than that great picture of ourselves , i want to sample another story . </s>
<s> a particularly nice story , like i am . </s>
<s> my wife told her . </s>
<s> she came from school one day , she &apos;s a teacher teacher , and she told me about a student . </s>
<s> a 16-year-old student . </s>
<s> they love it especially because it has a slope to it . </s>
<s> and she asked him , what are your hobbies ? </s>
<s> and so he says , well , i &apos;m at the firemen . </s>
<s> and because i &apos;m at the firemen , i &apos;m interested in pyrotechnics [tactical] things . </s>
<s> yes , you feel it when you &apos;re alacritous at this . that &apos;s not true . </s>
<s> i told my wife , whenever a person in a moral way , it &apos;s using the wörtchen process because we should try to replace it by wörtchen . </s>
<s> do that and then experience the sentence . </s>
<s> even though i &apos;m at the food department , i &apos;m interested in pyrotechnics [tactical] things . </s>
<s> you feel , that &apos;s the actual truth behind the auskunft . </s>
<s> such a little bit of bub , not a matter of interest . </s>
<s> that &apos;s the interest of feuermachen . </s>
<s> but there &apos;s no vereine that we can look at where to learn how to make fire . </s>
<s> it &apos;s just the second , you know , the firemen . </s>
<s> he signed up . </s>
<s> and besides besides , you don &apos;t tell your teacher that you &apos;d like to put fires in somewhere and be happy to be happy to hochlodert . </s>
<s> no , it looks much better when we show that we &apos;re in charge of to abolish the risks that others only create when they put fires . </s>
<s> they have this little mechanism here . </s>
<s> this is the verweis that he had in the innersten of the bub , that he was actually related to the fire , but that he can &apos;t say loud . </s>
<s> so here you &apos;ve got this zensor between the unconscious and the conscious , which is immediately anspringt , so that you can do something about it , and the things that you know about it , that they look very different , so that they can sound much better for them and other people . </s>
<s> and so it &apos;s just the words that we &apos;re using in the language of the political direct sprechens ever again . </s>
<s> actually , we know something else the case is . </s>
<s> but what we know when we to declare this is the social verhältnisse . </s>
<s> we can &apos;t do that . </s>
<s> it &apos;s impossible to present things like this in society that are supposed to work . </s>
<s> so let me tell you today what we found in my study . </s>
<s> so what logic does this delusion , this selbsttäuschung , the willingness , the other reality , that we actually know in the unconscious knowledge is that it &apos;s valid after Nov. 15 to spread outside . </s>
<s> i want to give you two , maybe three examples . </s>
<s> the first example comes ahead of what many of you are familiar with , and some of you would be aware of , just not need to . </s>
<s> i mean the soul . </s>
<s> what &apos;s the soul ? </s>
<s> the soul is such an intellectual , says about leibniz . </s>
<s> it &apos;s something that is not from stopping stofflicher , external nature . </s>
<s> and if you have people who are a firm , that they own a soul , and you can also say that they have been brought up from the soul to life , they &apos;re not made up of matter , it &apos;s just from its flesh and blood , something that is about stone lattice , it &apos;s only from its flesh , vergängliches , verwesbares , unwichtiges , unwichtiges
<s> and of that soul , you now think that they sort of be in the wolkigen nature , in these luftigen , anima , heißt , present . </s>
<s> and when that lufthauch only then over the people , it &apos;s filled with dignity , with nature , with nature that can only live , right now with soul . </s>
<s> and then he can to run away . </s>
<s> this is the idea of how the soul does . </s>
<s> so she &apos;s supposed to get out of the outside to the people . </s>
<s> so we &apos;re supposed to perceive them as something , which is to be present to our lives . </s>
<s> and if you have that premise in your mind , you can understand the logic that we see this happiness with a lie of our world . </s>
<s> because now you can apply an engine . </s>
<s> dreisatz know her from school . </s>
<s> this is now a dreisatz that describes a logic . </s>
<s> this is the hardest part of my talk . </s>
<s> they need some logic here , but also the willingness to lie . </s>
<s> that means to lie that they can use this logic wrong . </s>
<s> in this case , three sentences come up . </s>
<s> the first sentence is , klaus says , there &apos;s no soul . </s>
<s> so the second sentence is , if klaus is right , it doesn &apos;t have a soul . </s>
<s> now there &apos;s a third sentence . </s>
<s> i found him special . </s>
<s> third sentence , which immediately comes out with people who have a strong sense of a soul . </s>
<s> they say who don &apos;t have a soul , that &apos;s dead and cannot tell anything . </s>
<s> and that &apos;s where you feel it . </s>
<s> this is where this logic comes in this , yes , in this particular talk talk about expression . </s>
<s> you see it immediately . </s>
<s> the first two sentences , they are correct correct . </s>
<s> i can say everything . </s>
<s> the logic doesn &apos;t tell the reality . </s>
<s> i can say the kanzlerin is a man . </s>
<s> and if i &apos;m right , the kanzlerin is a man . </s>
<s> if i &apos;m not right , the kanzlerin is not a man . </s>
<s> the logic doesn &apos;t tell you what &apos;s true . </s>
<s> i can tell you everything . </s>
<s> but more important , if i &apos;m right , it &apos;s true . </s>
<s> so when klaus says there &apos;s no soul . </s>
<s> secondly , if it &apos;s right , it doesn &apos;t have a soul . </s>
<s> those things are correct right . </s>
<s> and now our original consciousness immediately feels that you can do something about it . </s>
<s> it depends on a third sentence , which has nothing to do with the first two sentences , and that &apos;s what it &apos;s like to be the opposite of the first sentence . </s>
<s> because , in fact , we &apos;ve got to prove whether or not there is the soul . </s>
<s> but with this logic that uses it , that two sentences are logical correctly , and a third dazuhängt , which looks like it could be something to do with it , we can save our lebenslüge . </s>
<s> so , we &apos;re doing as if it was impossible to live without a soul . </s>
<s> and we &apos;re very happy about it . </s>
<s> we can continue these things in different examples . </s>
<s> so , in the moment , we have a very modern scientific example , which keeps filling up the tageszeitungen . </s>
<s> this is what you need to do to another arts degree theme , to be de rigueur (for sb.) out of the philosophy , present . </s>
<s> this has to do with us go back to the fourteenth <14th> century . </s>
<s> there was a gelehrten , who was called johannes buridanus , and after that , the buridansche esel named . </s>
<s> the buridansche esel is a esel that &apos;s made by pure nature . </s>
<s> it doesn &apos;t have that soul . </s>
<s> this is a naturding . </s>
<s> and if you place that exactly in the middle , between two gleichgroßen heuhafen , it famished . </s>
<s> because he doesn &apos;t know what heuhaufen he should go to . </s>
<s> so , it &apos;s in the middle . </s>
<s> this is what the naturdinge presented . </s>
<s> gleichgroße forces with gegensätzlichem vorzeigenzeichen . </s>
<s> there &apos;s nothing happening at all . </s>
<s> it &apos;s only when you bring another example , so if you immediately make a haystack , it doesn &apos;t make any reason and there &apos;s nothing . </s>
<s> it automatically runs the right idea . </s>
<s> so if you have this idea that you &apos;re driven in nature , you &apos;re going to be driven by the larger that you can put in your hand , and you also have the feeling that it needs to be something like a free will . </s>
<s> and if we &apos;re also here in frankfurt , then i remember to complete what was said for brain . </s>
<s> there &apos;s a gelehrten , who &apos;s called wolf singer , and he sometimes tells you , wolf singer says , there &apos;s no willensfreiheit . </s>
<s> now we can make the second sentence again , and say , if wolf is right , it doesn &apos;t matter . </s>
<s> these sentences are absolutely logical and correct . </s>
<s> and what we can read almost every day in the daily daily , that &apos;s what they find in this third sentence . </s>
<s> it looks something that looks like , who don &apos;t have a willensfreiheit , can &apos;t be made for his actions and claims for responsibility , and so it &apos;s (legally) insane . </s>
<s> again , they have it again . </s>
<s> in fact , you really have to prove if there &apos;s something like willensfreiheit . </s>
<s> but the logic of deception allows us to do this way , as if the first sentence was wrong , as if the first sentence was wrong , as you might need to think of the opposite . </s>
<s> and now , if you want to do anything , if you want to do anything , if you want to test anything , and if you want to make things happy , you &apos;re going to be able to make people happy . </s>
<s> practice this for example , if you look at a person who can tell you , that &apos;s not rocket science . </s>
<s> and please don &apos;t use the german word for vorhersager , which is called the prophet . </s>
<s> they &apos;re not allowed to call this , that &apos;s what it would be like again . </s>
<s> you say , there &apos;s no vorhersager . </s>
<s> immediately , they &apos;re going to be able to figure out that there &apos;s vorhersager , you can &apos;t prove that . </s>
<s> and already , they have a problem . </s>
<s> because while you &apos;re busy , you realize that you can &apos;t prove that there &apos;s no vorhersager , the guy &apos;s perfectly happy . </s>
<s> he &apos;s very happy about it , because he deceived it . </s>
<s> because he led it to an fährte , where it &apos;s not slowing down . </s>
<s> because actually , this person is not interested in evidence . </s>
<s> he &apos;s only interested in being able to prove that there are vorhersager . </s>
<s> so , in the form of beweislast , you experience the issue of lying . </s>
<s> and once they have that kind of opportunity to feel this dreisatz thing in other people , they do it , because they &apos;re going to make others happy if they don &apos;t remember them in their selbstlüge . </s>
<s> thank you for your attention . </s>
<s> yeah , good afternoon . </s>
<s> so i &apos;ve been allowed to wonder if i could mention it . </s>
<s> she &apos;s one of the veranstalterinnen here by this great event , and i asked myself if i wanted to give up a talk and controlled my idea . </s>
<s> i have to say to be honest , you &apos;ve got it mitgekriegt , it was very difficult to tell me about my idea . </s>
<s> but i may be able to think of it , perhaps , that i &apos;m trying to imagine you . </s>
<s> but , of course , it &apos;s the sum , lots of ideas . </s>
<s> and i &apos;m just born , the two girls are still there , and i &apos;m probably part of the generation that has been using this bad öko image , because i &apos;ve already started studying robots in karlsruhe , engineering school , you know , i guess i do . </s>
<s> and it ended up in the back of the 80s for berlin , because i wanted to do renewable energy , and that was not in karlsruhe . </s>
<s> there was the Seven Wonders of the (Ancient) World leopoldshafen . </s>
<s> they were all kfa , and the jülich was called kfa . </s>
<s> the hot ones today . </s>
<s> because a good engineer has either fat chance [Aus.] [Br.] [coll.] [used ironically] cars or atomkraftanlagen . </s>
<s> but something like &quot; n solarpendel , &quot; which sort of herauskommt 100 watts out of the square meter , was a toy . </s>
<s> and in berlin , it was a crazy ingenieurkollektiv . </s>
<s> i &apos;m grateful to the premium-kola-mensch that he &apos;s got the word back again , because after the mauerfall , you couldn &apos;t use the word , because all the left was bad . </s>
<s> however , it wasn &apos;t in the achtiziger years . </s>
<s> it was the way that there was selbstverwaltete alternativbetriebe , and one of them was sitting in kreuzberg , where they thought that was evil . </s>
<s> the place of the terrorismusses , but that was called wuseltronik and has wind and sonnenenergie and then i started in the mitte . </s>
<s> and yes , much of what &apos;s been said today is very , very dear to me , because many , many beautiful statements were there that i &apos;ve been through . </s>
<s> i worked on the pond for 11 years , that was direct democratic . </s>
<s> we were 20 people . </s>
<s> when he said no , this is the vetoprinzip , and i &apos;ve got a to be beside oneself with joy . i &apos;ve been very hard to gezweifelt if i &apos;m going to really verschwende my really new day of whether or not myself , because all of the colleagues of my father used to zugeredet , you &apos;ve got the money on the window with your child . </s>
<s> it &apos;s employed at . </s>
<s> and it was really very , very acerbic , and they came in like this too seriously , and they showed that to a picture where i was asked , after 10 years , a thousand d-mark , einheitslohn , einheitslohn , in the collective of course , is to be really the great one . </s>
<s> and i then got to ninety-six endured , and then , with friends , i became solon the company of solon , which then became one of the largest zellenhersteller in the world . </s>
<s> so , one of the things we have , of course , is to go back and go back and go back to the next topic of the future and go back and think about the next world &apos;s next theme of the future and think it &apos;s the same mad thing that starts to say back again , that people will say , well , that &apos;s what &apos;s
<s> and there i gave you a project that i want you to imagine . </s>
<s> and the title of the speech was , yes , like 100 percent renewables . </s>
<s> and what we &apos;ve just done is we &apos;ve just started to ask with a fairly radical story , where to make any good value . </s>
<s> on this island , this is the island of graciosa on the azoren . </s>
<s> yeah , so that &apos;s the data . </s>
<s> there &apos;s 22 thousand people living . </s>
<s> they &apos;ve got an renewable energieanteil rate of 15 percent . </s>
<s> and the question is , why don &apos;t they have any ? </s>
<s> it &apos;s just not technological . </s>
<s> if you put more windkraft together together , the system starts to fail . </s>
<s> i &apos;m always telling you the politicians , if you were to to inspect our facility . </s>
<s> they &apos;re always saying , why ? </s>
<s> we already have 20 percent in germany . </s>
<s> it can &apos;t be a problem . </s>
<s> but it &apos;s not true , we &apos;ve got seven percent in europe , and our web is physically the european . </s>
<s> if we were in europe 20 percent , we would have the same problems that people have on this island . </s>
<s> the question was , &quot; rechnet , that was zweitausend2006 , did the first contacts with the island , just just keep it . </s>
<s> how big has you got to be a battery like this to be such an island for 20 , 30 , 40 , 50 , maybe even seventy percent of renewables . </s>
<s> and yeah , i &apos;m going to go again again . </s>
<s> the conventional system looks like this all over the world . </s>
<s> by the way , a year of about a hundred gigawatt electrical leistung on the planet . </s>
<s> this is the size of a hundred nuclear power , because it &apos;s very fast everywhere . </s>
<s> the energiehunger of the world , which is stattfindet , is blanked blanked because you don &apos;t need permission . </s>
<s> that &apos;s fast . </s>
<s> it &apos;s something called an x-ray box . </s>
<s> and then it looks the rule . </s>
<s> in the process , there are always three of the dieseln , two are getting waited . </s>
<s> yeah , this is what it looks like on the bottom is the load . </s>
<s> we also get very detailed data . </s>
<s> and whatever it is , or the solaranlage or whatever it is , is a back-up system , or whatever , in small amounts of to feed in . </s>
<s> our goal was to say it , okay . </s>
<s> it becomes back-up and the wind , the sun , the load of the load , that they can map the larger percentage . </s>
<s> and if you want to go over 20 , 30 percent renewables per year , energy per year , not the performance at the moment , then you have to turn off it . </s>
<s> that means , right now , you have to worry that renewables can be able to do the entire grid . </s>
<s> of course , you can only , of course , if you managed to be solved in some way . </s>
<s> so nobody in the world has no idea . </s>
<s> there &apos;s a lot of style in the small scale , so you can also use your rasierer rasierer with your rasierer . </s>
<s> people always ask me , &quot; what do you actually say in adlershof ? &quot; </s>
<s> this is what &apos;s happening . </s>
<s> but if you want some of these wechselrichtern to interconnect , and you &apos;re supposed to build a web , it becomes extremely complicated . </s>
<s> and our goal was , we wanted to go to 70 percent renewables , and then it &apos;s still the rest , the last rest , 20 percent renewables , which is going to be very , very expensive , and that &apos;s not going to work that they do that from batteries . </s>
<s> it &apos;s going to be an energy agency that will be hydrogen , hydrogen , methane , power to gas , you know , or sch , that will be it . </s>
<s> they &apos;ve got to go on an saisonalspeicher and go down and not just balance . </s>
<s> we just wanted to know , what about a normal , stinknormalen elektrochemischen battery . </s>
<s> well , how far do you get ? </s>
<s> and then they did lots of simulations . </s>
<s> and they got wind and sun and the last durchsimuliert and came to this with an extraordinary conclusion , which is a very exciting conclusion that you have to go to the conventional system , which after 20 years from about 50 cents a gallon . </s>
<s> these were the earliest calculations six years ago . </s>
<s> and then we said , okay . </s>
<s> is great , then we have a business model . </s>
<s> we &apos;re cheaper , like average , when the average price rises at five percent a year . </s>
<s> and then we started negotiating with the insulanern . </s>
<s> what needs to be done ? </s>
<s> negotiate with investors , i was looking for new gesellschafter . </s>
<s> we were only at the time five people to bring together into the society . </s>
<s> and here &apos;s the representation again . </s>
<s> the brown is kind of the conventional system , green is our system . </s>
<s> our system has a preisanstieg , is it &apos;s because we &apos;re going to make 20 percent of diesel , and also to be a code for sth. [coll.] [euphemism] a preissteigerung on the other things . </s>
<s> and the power-utility , which means the &quot; elektrizitätsversorgungsunternehmen &quot; on the island , means that &apos;s what we find . </s>
<s> but let &apos;s also support , but we don &apos;t believe you can solve the technical problem . </s>
<s> and so that &apos;s why we decided to build a hall in berlin in berlin , where we can sort of map the electrical verhältnisse of the island one . </s>
<s> that means we were looking for the first to find the largest battery in the world . </s>
<s> here she is . </s>
<s> this is where it comes from asia , in the case of japan . </s>
<s> and witzigerweise , in the &apos; 70s , is mannheim in bbc , this evening this evening , and then became auslizensiert to the japanese . </s>
<s> you can see it &apos;s a very , very large battery . </s>
<s> she has an example of performance and can bring it for six hours to make this performance , and that &apos;s the battery that we kind of have . </s>
<s> and they set them up . </s>
<s> we also have one of those diesel-aggregate in the same size that it stands up to the hall to actually look at the entire dynamic behavior from this web , so in the room it &apos;s like this , this is the great battery , this is the entire battery that we &apos;re doing with simulate the web . </s>
<s> this is where we simulate all the übertragungsleitungsystem , the kilometer-physik of the wire to sort of make the schwingungsverhalten in the grid . </s>
<s> and here you can see the whole thing again . </s>
<s> we can also aufschalten two hundred kilowatt photovoltaik onto the net . </s>
<s> this is what we see again , again , the fishery , again , the diesel , individual aggregate . </s>
<s> and what we &apos;ve been doing since zweitausendneun was the hall , until today , almost everything we did between the individual system of electronics to design software , we made it . </s>
<s> so we &apos;re not batteriehersteller , but we define ourselves as a company that is only between the subject of battery and the theme and everything in between . </s>
<s> you have to be able to communicate with the battery , you &apos;ve got to communicate in the web , and that &apos;s very complicated . </s>
<s> and the nice thing is that you &apos;re in the field that you &apos;re basically going to be able to do this island today , this is the kind of thing that we &apos;re going to get when we want to increase our level of renewables . </s>
<s> so this whole discussion , as is going to go back and forth at the moment and herbewegt , energiewende , how to go , on the island , for example , we have 30 percent exzessenergie , so we müdsen the wind and the sun . </s>
<s> natürlicht offers smart-grid . </s>
<s> so smart-grid , to be de rigueur (for sb.) everywhere . </s>
<s> we can now start to integrate elektromobilität , rumzufragen , you can use the load . </s>
<s> that means if you &apos;re at 70 percent renewables , you won &apos;t be able to do that without the memories . </s>
<s> you can smart-grid through &apos; n , you can do that by ausbau the nets , yes , you should be doing whatever you &apos;re going to do in any case , the value of to answer [prayer, plea] , but you can never get rid of memories on memory . </s>
<s> and that &apos;s kind of the message , sort of the message . </s>
<s> that &apos;s why a lot of people are coming and looking at this , because you can see what are the problems you get . </s>
<s> when we turn off the fishery , you have no more of these spinning mass that create a sort of inertia in the net . </s>
<s> and what we &apos;ve done is it &apos;s essentially made by rotating masses of large kraftwerken , where the wave all over the place go around all over europe . </s>
<s> we go into this grid , you look at the 50 colleges , and if it &apos;s going to point nine yards , we &apos;re going to start a few ventilchen aufzumachen , then again a little bit of merh steam goes back , then we come up again . </s>
<s> this is the system . </s>
<s> and of course , that &apos;s incredible . </s>
<s> if you add that somewhere , it will be a little bit ahead . </s>
<s> the spinning reserve reserve on least 10 seconds to keep the net rate . </s>
<s> and over time , they can respond to others again . </s>
<s> if you don &apos;t have that anymore , these origins are mass , then you have to replace that with leistungselektronik and elektrochemie . </s>
<s> and we can give up with these large battery two milliseconds . </s>
<s> and you &apos;ll see that there &apos;s enormous geschwindigkeitsmöglichkeiten there . </s>
<s> and the message now is , we have to give up these rotating masses , if we &apos;re about to do our goals 20 , 20 , 20 percent , 30 , 30 , 30 percent and so on when we want to get those at all . </s>
<s> then we need to break our must-run capacity in the net . </s>
<s> must-run is simple , the power station is going on to keep your frequency . </s>
<s> yes , that &apos;s an issue at the moment , zubau of kohlekraftwerken , because we don &apos;t otherwise , or gasturbinen , because that &apos;s not happening . </s>
<s> and what we &apos;re just trying to understand is that you can get off the capacity , the must-run capacity , to get off the net as well . </s>
<s> there &apos;s also a whole lot of studies to this right now . </s>
<s> and then the people always come and look at our versuchsstand and look at our versuchsstand . </s>
<s> and yes , the discussion always goes around the question of how far you can to anticipate a piece of future . </s>
<s> and many discussions that i had over the last six years , it was similar to the discussion that i had in the last 30 years . </s>
<s> it &apos;s not harmful , it &apos;s kinderspielkram , it &apos;s kinderspielkram , we have everything that never rechnet . </s>
<s> we &apos;ve got 30 gigawatt photovoltaik in germany today . </s>

<s> and i &apos;m just going to get out that in the next 30 years , the same capacity of energy are going to be able to store the same capacity . </s>
<s> very simple , that &apos;s how it &apos;s going to happen . </s>
<s> so there &apos;s all kinds of widerständen and arguments going on . </s>
<s> the nice thing is , i &apos;ve seen this in the last two years that scientists have seen on my side . </s>
<s> we &apos;ve got over 10 million förderprojekte , and we &apos;ve got an unprecedented net now to to be stuck . </s>
<s> it will take place in april . </s>
<s> so , from that reason , you realize that there &apos;s a change to this , and only from that abwehrhaltung , to the idea , hundreds and 100 percent renewables is true . </s>
<s> and if you have 100 percent renewable , it &apos;s like a autarkes system . </s>
<s> so , in fact , in discussions , these insulaner , these insulaner , are going to go together , which have a very small web , which has nothing to do with our verbund . </s>
<s> the question is very simple , if you do totally independently , of any fossil or uranen energierträgern that will be rausgebohrt anywhere in the world in the world , and then they &apos;re an island . </s>
<s> then they only use what they live on and wind and wind , where they live . </s>
<s> and this is a little bit of our vision of an vernüftigen energy supply , and i &apos;m grateful that they &apos;ve been told to use power . </s>
<s> and that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing , and this is where the talk of premium kola , that you &apos;re going to be able to be a collective and use power , in a little bit together . </s>
<s> and yeah , i just want to encourage you , in the sense that you can be quiet a little bit crazy and have a vision . </s>
<s> and you really have to get really chewy [meat] , but i think it &apos;s happening . </s>
<s> thank you . </s>
<s> as steve lopez , experimented of the los times , a day through the streets of los angeles , he heard a wonderful music . </s>
<s> she came from a man , afro-amerikaner , congenial [pleasant, sympathetic] , bitter , homeless , who played on a violin that had two strings . </s>
<s> many of you will know the story , because it &apos;s been a book that was filmed back in the back , in robert downey junior , he became a book that was in to close again , with robert anthony ayers , the kontrabassisten kontrabassisten , who was beginning to studierte at the juilliard-konservatorium , and completed the most honest career through his paranoid personality disorder schizophrenia . </s>
<s> nathaniel left juilliard , ended up a nervenzusammenbruch and 30 years later , he lived as a homeless , on the streets of skid row at the center of los angeles . </s>
<s> i recommend you to read steves &apos;s book or to look at the movie , not just to understand the wonderful connectedness that was made between these two men , but also how the music helped this connection , and how it finally allows the instrument , the mithalf is to get nathaniel away from the street . </s>
<s> i met mr. ayers in 2008 , two years ago , in walt disney concert hall . </s>
<s> he had just heard a presentation of beethoven &apos;s first and fourth symphony , and came behind the stage to imagine myself . </s>
<s> he spoke in a very cheery and geselligen clay about dr. we were and hillary and hillary clinton and how the koran could never create it in the baseball world , and all of this because of the tückischen passage of the first violin of beethoven fourth symphony . </s>
<s> we started talking about music . and a few days later , i got an email , and that said that nathaniel was interested on me . </s>
<s> and i still have to say that elvis have a medical treatment for it , because he was already treated with electric power and handschellen , a trauma that he has coined his entire life . </s>
<s> as a consequence of it , it &apos;s very prone to these schizophrenic edges . they &apos;re sometimes so bad , and it goes away from days in the streets of skid capsule , all the horror and folterqualen of its own mind . </s>
<s> and in the same way that he came up with monarchy when we started in walt disney concert hall , he started in the crazy to bicker [flames] to bicker [flames] in the hall , and he was completely lost . </s>
<s> he talked about invisible dämonen and smoke , and he wanted to cast him in their sleep . </s>
<s> i was afraid not as far as I'm concerned , but i was afraid that i could lose him in one of his states , and that i could destroy him his relationship to the violin when i began thinking about scale and arpeggios and other exciting forms of didaktischen geigenpädagogik . </s>
<s> so i just started playing . </s>
<s> i played the first sentence of beethoven violinkonzert . </s>
<s> and while i was playing , i noticed that in nathaniels &apos;s eyes , he had a complete transformation . </s>
<s> it was as if it was under an impact of a positive drug , a chemical response , whose katalysator . </s>
<s> nathaniels twitcher [Br.] [coll.] anger turn into understanding in a steady curiosity and grace . </s>
<s> and like he took his violin , he took his violin and began to stop hearing some snippets from violinkonzerten and asked me to go to the end : mendelssohn , tschaikowski , sibelius . </s>
<s> and then we started talking about music , from bach from beethoven , brahms , bruckner and all the other bs , from bartók to esa-pekka salonen . </s>
<s> and i realized that he was not only a enzyklopädisches knowledge of music , but she was involved with her in a tight personal relationship . </s>
<s> he talked about her with a passion and a understanding that i could know from my colleagues in the philharmonie of los angeles . </s>
<s> he was playing music and she was talking about music , that paranoiden , confused man , who was just through the streets of los angeles , a lovable rogue , cultured man , clean bill of health , in medieval trained musicians . </s>
<s> music is medicine . music changes us . </s>
<s> for nathaniel means music &apos;s emotional health . </s>
<s> because the music allows him to umzuformen his thoughts and delusions with the help of his imagination and creativity into something real . </s>
<s> and so he entflieht his quälenden . </s>
<s> and i understood that this is what the subject of art is . </s>
<s> this is the reason why we make music : we &apos;re going to do something that is deep in all of us , deep in our feelings , our feelings , through our artistic lens , the reality of reality . </s>
<s> and the reality of this expression is reaching us all , and it &apos;s inspired and inspired us and together . </s>
<s> so what nathaniel set set was that the music made him back into a community of friends . </s>
<s> the erlösende power of music took it back into a family of musicians who understood his talent and achtete it . </s>
<s> and i &apos;m always going to go back with apophis music , whether in the walt disney concert hall or in skid row , because he reminds me why i became a musician . </s>
<s> thank you . </s>
<s> bruno giussani : thank you very much . thank you . </s>
<s> robert gupta . </s>
<s> robert gupta : i want to play something i stole the cellisten . </s>
<s> i hope you &apos;ll pardon me . </s>
<s> so i &apos;ve known a lot of fish in my life . </s>
<s> i only loved two loved . </s>
<s> this first , that was more like a passionate . </s>
<s> it was a beautiful fish , delicious , good consistency , contentful , contentful , bestseller speisekarte . </s>
<s> what a fish . </s>
<s> even better , it &apos;s grown into aquakultur after the alleged highest standards of sustainability . </s>
<s> so you could think of selling it . </s>
<s> i had a conversation with this beauty over several months . </s>
<s> one day the leader of the company called up and asked if i could give you an event about the sustainability of the farm . </s>
<s> &quot; of course , &quot; i said . </s>
<s> there was a company that tried to solve this , which was to solve what &apos;s been the powerful problem for our köche . how are we holding fish on our speisekarten ? </s>
<s> over the last 50 years , we &apos;ve gotten the ocean to fish like we beat forests bare . </s>
<s> it &apos;s hard to get the destruction off . </s>
<s> 90 percent of the big fish that we love , the tunas , the heilbutte , the lachse , the schwertfisch , the schwertfisch , they were collapsed . </s>
<s> it &apos;s almost nothing left . </s>
<s> so , but ... however , but ... however , is a part of our future . </s>
<s> many arguments against it . fischzuchtanlagen to (make) muddy the environment that most of you anyway , and they &apos;re inefficient , we take tuna . a huge disadvantage . </s>
<s> he &apos;s got futterverwertung from 15 to one . </s>
<s> that means to be a pound , it needs to be a pound . </s>
<s> not very sustainable . </s>
<s> not very good either . </s>
<s> so finally , there was a company trying to make it right . </s>
<s> i wanted to give her up . </s>
<s> on the day of the conference , i called the ceo of öffentlichkeitsarbeit for the company . </s>
<s> let &apos;s call it go . </s>
<s> &quot; don &apos;t leave , &quot; i said , &quot; only to have the facts right , you &apos;re famous to be so far out of the sea that you &apos;re not contaminated environment . &quot; </s>
<s> &quot; that &apos;s true , &quot; he said , &quot; we &apos;re so far out that the waste is allocated by our fish . &quot; </s>
<s> and then he then added , &quot; we &apos;re basically a world of a world . </s>
<s> this is this view is encouraged by from 2.5 to one , he said . </s>
<s> &quot; the best in the sector . &quot; </s>
<s> one , great . </s>
<s> &quot; 2.5 to one . &quot; what do you feed ? &quot; </s>
<s> sustainable proteins , he said . </s>
<s> &quot; great , &quot; i said . i set up . </s>
<s> and that evening , i was in bed and thought , &quot; what is the hell of a deep protein ? &quot; </s>
<s> so i call the next day , just before the event , leave out . </s>
<s> i said , &quot; don &apos;t leave , for example , what are sustainable proteins ? &quot; </s>
<s> he said he didn &apos;t know that . he &apos;s going to give it an opinion . </s>
<s> now , i &apos;m telefonierte with a few people in the company . no one able to give me an answer , until i finally telefonierte with the senior biologist . </s>
<s> let &apos;s call it go as well . </s>
<s> &quot; don &apos;t leave , &quot; i said , &quot; what are sustainable proteins ? &quot; </s>
<s> well , he mentioned several algae and some fischmehle , and then he said , hühnchen-pellets . </s>
<s> i said , &quot; hühnchen-pellets ? &quot; </s>
<s> he said , &quot; yeah , feathers , skin , knochenmehl , reste , reste , dehumidified and futter . &quot; </s>
<s> i said , &quot; well , how much percent do you have chicken ? &quot; </s>
<s> in the case of maybe two percent . </s>
<s> &quot; well , that &apos;s about 30 percent , &quot; he said . </s>
<s> i said , &quot; don &apos;t leave , what is sustainable in feeding chicken ? &quot; </s>
<s> there was a long pause in line , and he said , &quot; there &apos;s just too much chicken in the world . &quot; </s>
<s> i entliebte from this fish . </s>
<s> no , not because i &apos;m a selbstgerechter genießer and gutmensch . </s>
<s> i actually am . </s>
<s> no , i was actually entliebt by this fish , because , i swear of god at god who tasted that conversation after chicken that conversation . </s>
<s> this second fish , that &apos;s another kind of love . </s>
<s> it &apos;s the romantic way , the way when you &apos;re more able to learn your fish , you &apos;ll love the fish more . </s>
<s> i was eating it first in a restaurant in südspanien . </s>
<s> he was talking to an friendlies reporter for a long time . </s>
<s> it sort of to get paired off us . </s>
<s> he came up with a bright , almost white white suit . </s>
<s> the chef had overcooked him . </s>
<s> hold twice . </s>
<s> amazingly , it was still delicious . </s>
<s> who can make a fish so much taste after he alone it ? </s>
<s> i can &apos;t , but this guy can . </s>
<s> let &apos;s call it miguel . in fact , it &apos;s miguel . </s>
<s> and no , it doesn &apos;t eat the fish , and it &apos;s not a chef , at least the way that i understand . </s>
<s> he &apos;s a biologist at veta la palma . </s>
<s> this is to be a code for sth. [coll.] [euphemism] ecke . </s>
<s> it &apos;s near the mouth of the river . </s>
<s> up to the 1980s , the farm was in the hands of argentiniern . </s>
<s> they grew fleischrinder on what was basically the feuchtgebiete . </s>
<s> they did that by turning out the land . </s>
<s> they were building this complicated episode of channels , and they pollute water out of the land and out into the river . </s>
<s> well , they couldn &apos;t get away that doing this , not economically . </s>
<s> and ecologically was a catastrophe . </s>
<s> it brought about 90 percent of the birds , which is a lot of birds for this place . </s>
<s> and so in 1982 , a spanish company has bought a spanish company . </s>
<s> what do they do ? </s>
<s> they have the flow of water . </s>
<s> they literally apportioned the lever . </s>
<s> instead of using the water , they used the channels to hereinzuziehen the water . </s>
<s> they were fluteten the canals . </s>
<s> they &apos;ve made an ethiopian species of fischaufzucht -- angular , meeräsche , meeräsche , garnele -- and so on , and his company changed ecological destruction completely . </s>
<s> the farm is incredible . </s>
<s> i mean , you never saw anything like that . </s>
<s> they stare out at the horizon , which is a million miles away , and all you see is geflutete channels and these density , pneumatic blonde [coll.] slides . </s>
<s> i didn &apos;t even have time with miguel there . </s>
<s> he &apos;s an incredible guy , three parts charles darwin and a piece of &quot; a krokodil . &quot; </s>
<s> okay ? so what we were doing was we fought and struggled through the feuchtgebiete and i keuche and schwitze , and exhausted to my knees , and miguel skimps skimps . </s>
<s> he put out an extra gleitaar . </s>
<s> now , he mentioned the mineralbedürfnisse of hamburg . </s>
<s> and here , he sees a pattern of concentrate that reminds him to the tansanische giraffe . </s>
<s> it turns out that miguel spent most of his career at the mikumi national park in africa . </s>
<s> i asked him how to become a fisch-experten . </s>
<s> he said , &quot; fish ? i don &apos;t know anything about fish . </s>
<s> i am an expert for relations . &quot; </s>
<s> and then it &apos;s going to fall in more talk of rare birds and algae and weird wasserpflanzen . </s>
<s> and don &apos;t get me wrong , that was really fascinating , you know , the biotic factors community unplugged ® . </s>
<s> it &apos;s great , but i was in love . </s>
<s> and my head got faint over this verkochte piece of köstlichen fish that i had on the vorabend . </s>
<s> so i interrupted it . i said , &quot; miguel , how does it taste your fish so well ? &quot; </s>
<s> he showed up the algae . </s>
<s> &quot; i know , boy , the algae , the rockefeller , the relationships , that &apos;s incredible . </s>
<s> but what do you eat ? </s>
<s> what &apos;s the futterverwertung ? &quot; </s>
<s> well , he continued to tell me that it &apos;s a rich system that the fish eat what they were going to eat in the wild . </s>
<s> the wages , the phytoplankton , the phytoplankton , that &apos;s what the fish feeds . </s>
<s> the system is so healthy , it &apos;s just selbsterneuernd . </s>
<s> there &apos;s no food . </s>
<s> are we hearing by a farm that doesn &apos;t feed their animals ? </s>
<s> and later on the day , i flew around with miguel and i asked him , &quot; for a place that seems like this , of course , it seems like , &quot; but any farm that i &apos;ve ever been , &quot; how do you care success ? &quot; </s>
<s> in the moment , it was as if a director knew a bühnenwechsel . </s>
<s> and we go around the corner , and we offered the most incredible sight , thousands and thousands of pinker flamingos , a literally global carpet . </s>
<s> &quot; that &apos;s success , &quot; he said . </s>
<s> &quot; look at your bäuche , pink . </s>
<s> they &apos;re to debauch . &quot; </s>
<s> to debauch ? i was completely confused . </s>
<s> i said , &quot; miguel , do you dare your fish ? &quot; </s>
<s> &quot; yes , &quot; he said . </s>
<s> &quot; we &apos;re losing 20 percent of our fish and fischeiern to the birds . </s>
<s> well last year , on this site , 600,000 birds were over 250 different species . </s>
<s> today , it &apos;s the largest and one of the most important private vogelreservate . </s>
<s> i said , &quot; miguel , isn &apos;t a good gedeihender vogelbestand the last thing you want to do on a fischaufzucht ? &quot; </s>
<s> he schüttelte his head no . </s>
<s> he said , &quot; we &apos;re building extensive models , not intense . </s>
<s> this is a ecological thinking network . </s>
<s> flamingos eat the shrimp . </s>
<s> the shrimp eat the phytoplankton . </s>
<s> so , the state of your gut is better the system . &quot; </s>
<s> okay , let &apos;s to reconceive it up . a farm that does not feed their animals and a farm that measures your success at your health . </s>
<s> one fischaufzucht , another vogelreservat . </s>
<s> oh , and by the way , these flamingos should not even be there . </s>
<s> they breed in a city at 12 miles away where the bodenbeschaffenheit is better for the nestbau . </s>
<s> they fly down to the farm every morning . </s>
<s> and they fly for 240 miles each evening . </s>
<s> you do this because you can follow the gestrichelten white line of the landstraße a92 . </s>
<s> seriously . </s>
<s> i had introduced a kind of journey of penguins , so i looked at miguel . </s>
<s> i said , &quot; miguel , are you going to fly 240 kilometers to the farm and fly 240 miles back to the speed ? </s>
<s> do they do that for children ? &quot; </s>
<s> he looked at me , like i was quoted a song by whitney houston . </s>
<s> he said , &quot; no . you do this because the food is better . &quot; </s>
<s> i didn &apos;t mention the skin of my loved fish that was delicious , and i don &apos;t like fischhaut . i don &apos;t like it sauté . i don &apos;t like it . </s>
<s> it &apos;s this aggressive remark , verkohlte taste . </s>
<s> i almost never cook with it . </s>
<s> and yet , when i tried it in this restaurant in südspanien , she didn &apos;t tasted it at all . </s>
<s> she liked sweet and pure , like taking a bite from the ocean . </s>
<s> i mentioned miguel and he alone . </s>
<s> he said , &quot; the skin seems like a sponge . </s>
<s> she &apos;s the last , before making something in the body . </s>
<s> it &apos;s evolved in the course of evolution to unreinheiten unreinheiten . &quot; </s>
<s> and then he then added , &quot; but our water doesn &apos;t . &quot; </s>
<s> okay . a farm that doesn &apos;t feed their fish -- a farm that measures your success at success . </s>
<s> and then i realized , if he says a farm that has no unreinheiten , it untertreibt massive , because the water that is flowing through this farm is guadalquivir . </s>
<s> it &apos;s a river that leads to all of the things that are doing all the things that are developing these days with each other , including pollutants , abfluss of schädlingsbekämpfungsmitteln . </s>
<s> and if it &apos;s fought through the system , and this leaves is warm , as it is . </s>
<s> the system is so healthy , it cleans the water . </s>
<s> so not just a farm that doesn &apos;t feed your animals , not just a farm that measures your success at your health for your co2 , but a farm that is literally a wasser-aufbereitungsanlage , and not only those fish , but for you and me . </s>
<s> because if the water herausfließt , it versinkt in the atlantic . </s>
<s> a drop in the ocean , i know , but i &apos;m going to take it , and you should also do that because that love , how romantic is , is also telling . </s>
<s> you might say that she &apos;s a recipe for the future of good food , whether we talk about angular or fleischrindern . </s>
<s> what we need now is a radical new concept of agriculture , of one , in fact , in fact , a lot of to blend in well (with sth.) . </s>
<s> but for many people , it &apos;s too radical . </s>
<s> we &apos;re not realisten , we &apos;re genießer . we &apos;re liebhaber . </s>
<s> we love wochenmärkte . we love small familienbetriebe . we &apos;re talking about local food . we eat organic . </s>
<s> and if they claim that these are the things that the future of good food says is somewhere and says , &quot; hey guys , i love pinke flamingos , but how are you going to feed the world ? </s>
<s> how are you going to feed the world ? &quot; </s>
<s> can i be honest ? </s>
<s> i don &apos;t like that question . </s>
<s> no , not because we &apos;re producing enough calories to feed the world more than only . </s>
<s> a billion people today are to hunger after . </s>
<s> one billion -- that &apos;s more than ever before -- because of babe in the woods inequalities in the distribution , not the gesamtproduktion . </s>
<s> now , i don &apos;t like this question because they &apos;ve been doing the logic of our nahrungssystems for the last 50 years . </s>
<s> feed grain of herbivores , schädlingsbekämpfungsmittel of monokulturen , chemicals to the earth , chicken of fish , and all of the time , it just says , &quot; if we feed more people cheaper , how awful can it be ? &quot; </s>
<s> that was the cause . it was the rechtfertigung . it was the medical agriculture plan . </s>
<s> we should call it what it &apos;s like to call an assault in abwicklung , an agent that allow fast ecological thinking drugs that allow this production . </s>
<s> this is not an interface , and it &apos;s not agriculture . </s>
<s> our energy policy is threatened today , not by fire decay zufuhr , but because of fire decay resources . </s>
<s> not by the latest mähdrescher- and traktor-erfindungen , but through fertile land , not by pumps from pumps , but through fresh water , not by kettensägen , but through forests , not by fischerboote and nets , but by fish . </s>
<s> you want to feed the world ? </s>
<s> let &apos;s start with the question : how are we going to feed ourselves ? </s>
<s> or better , how can we create conditions that encourage any community that causes any community to feed themselves ? </s>
<s> to do that , you don &apos;t look at the agrarindustrie-modell for the future . </s>
<s> it &apos;s really old , and it &apos;s done . </s>
<s> capital , chemistry and machines are at the top in it , and it never produced anything really good to eat . </s>
<s> but instead , look at the ecological model . </s>
<s> this is that , in two billion years , zurückgreift . </s>
<s> look at miguel , farmers like miguel . </s>
<s> in classrooms that are not the worlds for themselves , businesses , that are not going to be wiederherstellen instead of aufzubrauchen , companies that are growing up , rather than just intense , farmers that are not only available , but experts for relationships . </s>
<s> because they &apos;re the ones who are experts on taste . </s>
<s> and if i &apos;m really honest , you &apos;re a better chef than i &apos;m going to be . </s>
<s> you know , i &apos;m right , because if that &apos;s good food , it &apos;s going to be delicious . </s>
<s> thank you . </s>
<s> if i &apos;m going to put you today to you today , it &apos;s the sum of the data that we consume is bigger than the sum of your parts and instead of thinking about informationsüberladung , and i want you to think about how we can use information so much that patterns are produced and we don &apos;t recognize the trends that have otherwise been realized . </s>
<s> so , what we &apos;re seeing here is a typical sterbediagramm for age . </s>
<s> the program i use here is a small experiment . </s>
<s> it &apos;s pivot , and what i can do with pivot is that i can filter by a particular cause of cause , we say accidents . </s>
<s> and immediately i see another pattern that makes it . </s>
<s> and that &apos;s because in the mittelbereich here , people are most active and they &apos;re over here . </s>
<s> we can go step further , and get rid of data and see the data and see that kreislauferkrankungen and cancer are the usual suspects , but not everybody . </s>
<s> now , if we continue on and at the age of age , we &apos;re going to see 40 years of accidents , that accidents , actually , is that accidents should be concerned about . </s>
<s> and whoever weiterforscht sees that this is largely true at men . </s>
<s> so what you can see is that this is looking at data and data in this way that are very much remembered in swimming . </s>
<s> and if we can do that for raw data , why not do that for content ? </s>
<s> now what we &apos;re looking at here is each individual , &quot; hometown illustrated , &quot; which have ever been printed . </s>
<s> it &apos;s all here . it &apos;s all online . </s>
<s> you can test it from my talk in your rooms . </s>
<s> you can put it in a decade . </s>
<s> they can be buried in a certain year . </s>
<s> you can jump directly to a specific copy . </s>
<s> now if i look over here , i look at the athletes that appear in this issue and the sportarten . </s>
<s> i &apos;m a lance armstrong fan , so i &apos;ll click on it all at the time i &apos;m going to show you all spending . </s>
<s> now , if i just want to get a gröberen track , i could think , &quot; ok , what if i looked at all of that fahrradfahren ? &quot; </s>
<s> so i go back and erweitere the perspective . </s>
<s> now i see greg lemond . </s>
<s> and so you get an idea that if you look at this kind of information , surgical strike , taller , to zoom in , to zoom out , to zoom out , they don &apos;t search , then you don &apos;t search or surft . </s>
<s> you make something that is actually a bit different . </s>
<s> it &apos;s something in between , and we think it changes the way information can be used . </s>
<s> now , i want to do this idea more now with something a little bit crazy . </s>
<s> what we &apos;ve been doing here is we took every single sample of wikipediaseite and reduce it to a little summary . </s>
<s> the summary contains a short overall and a symbol for the bereich . </s>
<s> i &apos;ll just show you the top of the top 500 wikipediaseiten . </s>
<s> but even in the rough point , we can do a lot of things . </s>
<s> immediately , we get a sense of the topics that are populärsten on wikipedia . </s>
<s> i &apos;m going to choose the theme of government . </s>
<s> now , after i chose &apos; government &apos; s , i realize that the wikipediakategorien that most people share with each of the year . </s>
<s> this is really important , because this is a realization that &apos;s not in a single wikipediaseite . </s>
<s> it &apos;s just to realize that if you step back and look at this . </s>
<s> i can go to a certain of these summaries in the theme of time , &quot; people of the year , &quot; go in and see all together . </s>
<s> so if i look at all these people , i realize that most of them are regierungsbeamte . some of them are coming from science . some , less , come from the economy . here &apos;s my boss . and one comes out of the musikbereich . </s>
<s> and interestingly , also bono is a ted tea . </s>
<s> so we can jump and look at all the ted &apos;s ted . </s>
<s> you can see , in the web , the first time it &apos;s the first time it &apos;s a grid , not just to page , but much more abstract . </s>
<s> and so i want to show you what a little surprise might be . </s>
<s> let me show you just the new york times website . </s>
<s> pivot , this app -- i don &apos;t want to call it a browser ; it &apos;s really not a browser , but you can look at web sites -- and we get these zoom-technologie to every single website like this . </s>
<s> so i can go back and jump directly to a specific kind of sektion . </s>
<s> that &apos;s because that &apos;s important , because you only go through the microscope of paper in this way , in this way , all the internet-verlauf . </s>
<s> so i can zoom into my journey in a particular position . </s>
<s> this is the state of the entire demonstration that i thought i was going on . </s>
<s> and i can kind of see everything i looked at today , again , again . </s>
<s> and when i go back and look again and look at everything and look at everything , i can distribute my journey in time after my such-vergangenheit . here , i looked for nepotistic , here to bing , or here to live labs . </s>
<s> and from this , i can go into the page and visit her . </s>
<s> it &apos;s a metaphor that &apos;s used over and over again , and each time it makes the full greater than the sum of datenteile . </s>
<s> right now , in this world , we think data is a curse . </s>

<s> we &apos;re talking about &quot; drowning in information . &quot; </s>
<s> what if we could reverse this situation and put the internet on their heads so that we could always start to go from one to another , to start with a lot of things that are otherwise going on . </s>
<s> if we can do that , then this past datenfalle , maybe a new source of more sensible information . </s>
<s> and , instead of moving in information , we can get knowledge from it . </s>
<s> and if we experience knowledge , maybe we can even pull out weisheiten . </s>
<s> so i hear that , thank you . </s>
<s> i grew up with a gehörigen new fiction fiction . </s>
<s> in my high school , i went to school with the bus every day . </s>
<s> and my nose always put my nose in a book , an science-fiction-buch that entführte my mind into other worlds and to be consensual my deep wise woman in my sitting work posture , insect curiosity . </s>
<s> this curiosity also showed that if i was not at school , through the forests , wanderte and wanderte and &quot; samples &quot; collected , frogs and snakes and bugs and teichwasser , and looked at everything home and looked at the microscope . </s>
<s> i was totally wissenschaftsbegeistert , you know . </s>
<s> it was always about trying to understand the world and explore the limitations of the possible . </s>
<s> and my love to science fiction seemed to look in my environment , because at the time , in the late &apos; 60s , we flew to the moon . </s>
<s> jacques cousteau came into our living rooms with his fascinating shows that are animals and places and a world full of miracles that we could never imagined before . </s>
<s> and i guess that &apos;s probably very much to the science-fiction-rolle been suitable . </s>
<s> and i was an artist . </s>
<s> i could draw . i could paint . </s>
<s> and since there was no video video that i &apos;ve had to do with computergenerierten movies , all the stuff that was available in the media media , i had to create the photos in my head . </s>
<s> this is what we all had to do . if we were kids as a book , we took the description of the autors and projizierten them to our heads . </s>
<s> my response to this was to draw and painting from aliens , alien worlds , robots , raumschiffen and all kinds of things . </s>
<s> in the morning , i was always caught by the teacher , i was herummalte in the textbook . </s>
<s> the creativity had to go kind of out . </s>
<s> and something interesting happened . what fascinated me about jacques cousteaus shows was the idea of an entirely true world on earth itself . </s>
<s> surely i would never get an alien world with a spaceship . it seemed pretty unlikely to me . </s>
<s> but here was a world that i could actually walk in here on earth , and it was just astonishing and exotic as all of the things that i &apos;ve always imagined when i &apos;d read those books . </s>
<s> so i decided , when i was 15 , she decided to be divers . </s>
<s> the only problem with this was i was living in a small village in canada , an 000 from the nearest ocean . </s>
<s> i didn &apos;t get frustrated from it . </s>
<s> i nervte my father , until he finally had a tauchschule in buffalo , new york , noticed right on the other side of the border where we lived . </s>
<s> i made my tauchschein in a pool of ymca in the middle of buffalo , new york . </s>
<s> the ocean , however , a physical ocean , i got to face two years later when we moved to california . </s>
<s> since then , in the 40 years that i &apos;ve been elapsed , i spent about eight hours in water , 500 hours in tauchbooten . </s>
<s> and i &apos;ve learned that the world of the deep ocean , even in the flacheren oceans , is so rich as rich life as we can actually imagine it . </s>
<s> the imagination of nature doesn &apos;t know borders , but unlike our own , kläglichen human imagination . </s>
<s> up to today , i feel utter awe for what i see on my dives . </s>
<s> and my love to the ocean is holding , with the same intensity and ever . </s>
<s> when i first approached a job , it was the filmemachen . </s>
<s> this seemed like the best way to tell my inner , to be able to tell stories with my need to create images . </s>
<s> as a kid , i was zeichnete books and so on . </s>
<s> so movies were gone to bring pictures and stories . that fit together . </s>
<s> and of course , the stories that i came up with from the science-fiction-bereich : &quot; terminator , &quot; &quot; &quot; aliens , &quot; and &quot; abyss . &quot; </s>
<s> for &quot; abyss , &quot; i could connect my vorliebe for the unterwasserwelt and the to dive (for) . </s>
<s> so , sort of my two passions . </s>
<s> something interesting happened at &quot; abyss : &quot; to solve a erzählerisches problem in this movie -- and this is what we needed to create kind of liquid wasserwesen , cg , cg . </s>
<s> what it came out was the first computergenerierte soft-surface-figur that was ever seen in a movie . </s>
<s> the movie didn &apos;t bring money to say , in fact , he was doing his energy , but i noticed something fascinating : the audience around the world was like hypnotised  [Br.] from the magic that ended up . </s>
<s> according to arthur clarke &apos;s law , you know fortgeschrittliche technology and magic no one else . </s>
<s> so they saw something very magical . </s>
<s> and i found that really interesting . </s>
<s> and i thought , &quot; wow , that really needs to be involved in the filmkunst . &quot; </s>
<s> so we went to &quot; terminator 2 , &quot; my next movie , still further . </s>
<s> so with ilm , we made out that guy from liquid metal , and the success of this effect was going on . </s>
<s> and it worked . again , we created something magic , and the impact in the audience was the same , but we got a little bit of money with this film . </s>
<s> from those two experiences , a whole new world was reached a whole new world of creativity for filmschaffende . </s>
<s> so i started a company , along with my good friend driven cohen , who was the best make-up- rather than and creature-designer . it was called digital domain . </s>
<s> the idea of this company was to to jump across the phase of visual printers and start with visual printers and start with digital produktionen . </s>
<s> so we did that also and we gave us an advantage of it . </s>
<s> but in the middle of the 1990s , we discovered that we were at the creature- and character-design -- what we actually created the company -- too slowly . </s>
<s> i wrote this piece &quot; avatar , &quot; which was going to be the bar in the visual effects and computergenerierter effects in entirely new altitudes , with virtually human man-made characters that have been made by cg , and the hauptfiguren should be all cg , and the world should be cg . </s>
<s> but the bar bar , it was very good , and people in my company told me that we didn &apos;t even be able to do that . </s>
<s> so i made this work , and i made this new film about the great ship . </s>
<s> i got that as &quot; romeo and juliet on a ship . &quot; it &apos;s been sold a liebesfilm of epic proportions [postpos.] scale , a passionate movie . </s>
<s> but i wanted to actually hinabtauchen the titanic for the titanic . </s>
<s> that &apos;s why i made the movie . </s>
<s> that &apos;s the truth . the studio didn &apos;t know . </s>
<s> but i convinced you , by saying , &quot; we are going to the wreckage . we film the real wrack . </s>
<s> we &apos;re going to show it in the eröffnungssequenz of the movie . </s>
<s> that &apos;s really important . it &apos;s a good aufhänger for marketing . &quot; </s>
<s> and i convinced her to pay an expedition . </s>
<s> sounds mad . but this is coming back to the fact that your imagination can create reality . </s>
<s> we actually made a reality , actually , six months later , when i was in a russian tauchboot , wiederfand , fundament [hum.] [a person's buttocks] , fundament [hum.] [a person's buttocks] , to be an also-ran , to be an also-ran , the real titanic . </s>
<s> this wasn &apos;t a movie , to stiff [sl.] [fail to tip or tip inadequately] , that was real . </s>
<s> so , that really blew my mind . </s>
<s> and they were very huge , and we needed to build cameras and house and grounds for discretionary refusal . </s>
<s> and i noticed how much these tiefseetauchgänge , like a weltraummission . </s>
<s> well , they were also highly technical and bedurften . </s>
<s> you go into these capsule , you put down into this dark , hostile environment environment , where there &apos;s no hope on saving when you can &apos;t get it back . </s>
<s> and i thought , &quot; wow , that &apos;s just the way i was in a science-fiction-film . </s>
<s> that &apos;s really cool . &quot; </s>
<s> i was quite obsessed with studying the deep sea . </s>
<s> anyway , from the part that has to do with curiosity and science . it was everything . it was all of adventure . it was all curiosity . it was a imagination . </s>
<s> and it was a whole experience that i couldn &apos;t get hollywood . </s>
<s> because , you know , i was able to introduce a sense of a creature where we could make a visual effect for that , but i couldn &apos;t imagine what i was going to see from the fensters . </s>
<s> in some of the same expeditions i &apos;ve seen in thermalquellen , and sometimes things that i &apos;ve never seen before , sometimes things that have never been seen before , and also the science that has never seen before , and the science at the time we saw it , has never found words . </s>
<s> so that really knocked over me , and i wanted more . </s>
<s> and so i came up with an unusual decision . </s>
<s> after the success of &quot; titanic , &quot; i said , &quot; okay , i want to put my hauptberuf as a filmmaker in hollywood in hollywood and get vollzeit-forscher for a while . &quot; </s>
<s> and then we started , we started with &quot; bismarck , &quot; and they explored them with roboterfahrzeugen . </s>
<s> we went back to the wreckage in the titanic . </s>
<s> we took little robots that we built , which was a fiberglaskabel abwickelten . </s>
<s> our intention was to hineinzutauchen and to look at the inner of the boat what was never done before . </s>
<s> no one had ever explored the inner of the wracks . you didn &apos;t have any resources for it , so we developed the technologie technology . </s>
<s> so i &apos;m sitting there now , on the deck of the titanic , in a tauchboot , and see planken , which are very similar to these to travel [coll.] [move quickly by car] , and that i know once , has played the line . </s>
<s> and i fly with a little roboterfahrzeug through the gänge of the ship . </s>
<s> but i actually did it only , but my consciousness is within the vehicle . </s>
<s> it felt like i present physically within the process of the titanic . </s>
<s> this was the surrealste form of a déjà-vu that i &apos;ve ever seen , because before i took over a corner , i always knew what was going on in the lichtkegel of the vehicle because i was walking through the movie for months . </s>
<s> and the set was a really detailed copy of the baupläne of the ship . </s>
<s> so that was a really strange experience . </s>
<s> she made this telepräsenz-erlebnis sense that you &apos;re using such roboterhafte avatare and so your consciousness in the vehicle , in that other form of existence . </s>
<s> it was really extraordinary profound . </s>
<s> and maybe a little snapshot of what might happen in a couple of decades when you &apos;ve got cyborg-körper to explore something like something to explore or do other things , in all kinds of post-humanen zukunftszenarios that i can think of as science-fiction-fan . </s>
<s> so after that expeditions , we started to appreciate what we were seeing down there , for example , this tiefseequellen where we saw these incredibly amazing animals , and that &apos;s kind of extraterrestrial intelligence extraterrestrial intelligence , but here . </s>
<s> they live with chemosynthese . </s>
<s> they don &apos;t exist in any sunlight solar system as we do that . </s>
<s> and so , you see animals that can survive right next to a 500 degrees c that they can survive there . </s>
<s> at the same time , i was really interested in weltraumwissenschaft , which was back to my childhood . </s>
<s> and so , i ended up with the people who are in interested with space and staying down and real weltraummissionen , and they go to russia , through the mission of the mission record , all and sundry everything called for that reason and to bite the dust [coll.] , and then they go to the global weltraumstation and take our 3d-kamerasysteme . </s>
<s> that was fascinating . </s>
<s> but at the end , it was going out that i took weltraumwissenschaftler with us in the deep sea . </s>
<s> and i took them with them to go to the world on the bottom -- astrobiologen , planetenwissenschaftler , people who were interested in such extraordinary situations . i took them to the vents so that they could take samples and test the instruments and so forth . </s>
<s> well , we did mix with it , but actually , really science , weltraumwissenschaft . </s>
<s> so , the circle of my existence , as science-fiction-fan , at the time , as a child , as a child , and the umsetzung . </s>
<s> so in the course of this journey , i learned a lot . </s>
<s> so i &apos;ve learned a lot about science . but i &apos;m sure now that i &apos;m sure you need to get a director , a leader like a schiffskapitän or something . </s>
<s> but i didn &apos;t really understand much of leadership before i antrat these expeditionen . </s>
<s> because at a certain point , i had to say , &quot; what am i doing here ? </s>
<s> why do i do that ? what &apos;s going on ? &quot; </s>
<s> these blöden films don &apos;t give us money . </s>
<s> we &apos;re going to play the money . there &apos;s no trace . </s>
<s> everybody thinks i was between &quot; titanic , &quot; and &quot; avatar , &quot; and i would put the nägel on a towel on the beach . </s>
<s> i &apos;ve got all of these films , these things , for a very small audience . </s>
<s> no glory , no honor , no money . what do you do ? </s>
<s> you make it by the task to get the challenge -- and the ocean is the herausforderndste environment that exists . you make it for the entdeckerrausches , and because of the weird connection that comes , you create a team . </s>
<s> because we &apos;ve done all of this with only 10 to 12 people who worked on it for years , and sometimes it was two to three months to lake . </s>
<s> and in this community , you realize that the most important thing that &apos;s convinced to each other is because you &apos;ve solved an effort that can &apos;t explain anyone else . </s>
<s> if you go back to land and say , &quot; we had to do it , the fiberglas , the schallschwächung , and the real stuff , the human leistungsvermögen , if you &apos;re working on lake , you can &apos;t explain the other one . that &apos;s just like , you know , you can &apos;t explain the other one . this is like a police officer or at
<s> and there &apos;s a link , mutual respect . </s>
<s> so when i came back to turn my next movie , &quot; avatar , &quot; i tried to use the same leadership , which is that you deserve your team , and it deserves your respect in return . </s>
<s> it really changed the dynamics . </s>
<s> so i came back with a little team on unbekanntem terrain , and we did &quot; avatar &quot; with a new technology that hadn &apos;t been there before . </s>
<s> incredibly exciting . </s>
<s> an enormous challenge . </s>
<s> and we went to a real family for a period of four and a half years . </s>
<s> it changed my way of making films . </s>
<s> there were people who thought we had these ozeanwesen really bogus and pandora the planet . </s>
<s> for me , it was more of a way to do my job , the actual process that changed the results . </s>
<s> so what can we close from all this ? </s>
<s> what are the lessons we learned ? </s>
<s> i think , first , the curiosity is . </s>
<s> it &apos;s the most powerful human property . </s>
<s> our imagination is a force that can actually create a reality . </s>
<s> and the achtung of your team is more important than all lorbeer of the world . </s>
<s> i get young filmmakers who are saying , &quot; give me an advice of how to do something like this . &quot; </s>
<s> and i say , &quot; don &apos;t give you yourself . </s>
<s> that &apos;s what people get for you . don &apos;t worry about yourself . don &apos;t bet on yourself . they take risks . &quot; </s>
<s> nasa has so to get a (good / severe) ticking-off [coll.] , &quot; fail is not an alternative . &quot; </s>
<s> but in the art and studies , there &apos;s needs to be an alternative , because there &apos;s a vertrauensvorschuss . </s>
<s> not an important endeavor for innovation , has never been at risk . </s>
<s> you have to be willing to go up with risks like this . </s>
<s> this is the idea that i &apos;d like to give you with on the way . failure is an alternative , fear is not . thank you . </s>
<s> today i &apos;m talking to you about energy and climate . </s>
<s> and this might surprise something because my favorite group of the foundation is mostly about vaccines and seed to make the things that we need to invent and deliver to make the poorest two billion a better life . </s>
<s> but energy and climate are extremely important to these people , actually more important than any other one on the planet . </s>
<s> klimaverschlechterung means that their saaten are not going to grow over many years . it &apos;s too much richer . it &apos;s too few things -- things are going to change the things that can &apos;t withstand their fragile environment . </s>
<s> it leads to hungersterben . it leads to uncertainty . it leads to unruhen . </s>
<s> so , change is going to be an awful man . </s>
<s> and also , the energiepreis for them is very important . </s>
<s> the fact is that , if you could only reduce the price from one thing , energy would be far more effective . </s>
<s> well , the energiepreis has fallen over time . </s>
<s> in fact , the fortschrittsgesellschaft is based on energiefortschritten . </s>
<s> the kohlerevolution set up the industrial revolution , and even in the 20th century , it gave us a constant case in elektrizitätspreis , so we have refrigerators , klimaanlagen , we can make modern materials and so many things . </s>
<s> so we &apos;re in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world . </s>
<s> but , if we lower the price -- let &apos;s go to the price -- let &apos;s go to a new barrier -- let &apos;s go to a new barriere , and this gap depends with co2 . </s>
<s> co2 warming the planet and the equation of co2 is actually quite clear . </s>
<s> they to add up the ausgestoßene co2 that leads to temperaturerhöhung , and these temperaturerhöhung have some very negative consequences . effects on the weather and maybe worse , the expenses incidental to unloading consequence that the natural ecosystems can &apos;t adapt a very functional change . </s>
<s> now , the exact difference between a co2-anstieg and as a formality temperaturveränderung and where the other consequences are , there &apos;s some unklarheiten , but not very many . </s>
<s> and there is certainly ambiguity of how bad these results are going to be , but they &apos;re going to be extremely bad . </s>
<s> and i asked the top-wissenschaftler several times , &quot; well , we really got to go down to 30 ? </s>
<s> does not just be a quarter or a quarter ? &quot; </s>
<s> the answer is until we get close to zero , it &apos;s going to continue to increase temperature . </s>
<s> that &apos;s why it &apos;s a very challenging challenge . </s>
<s> it &apos;s very different to say , you know , we have a 3,5 truck that has to go under a 3 meter of the bridge , and then you can put it in . </s>
<s> this has got to go down to zero . </s>
<s> well , we set up a lot of kohlenstoffdioxid , over 26 billion tons . </s>
<s> so , each americans americans are about 20 tons . people from poor countries , less than one . </s>
<s> it &apos;s about five tons for each one on the planet . </s>
<s> and somehow we need to create changes that are down to zero . </s>
<s> it &apos;s gone up forever . </s>
<s> but only different economic changes have changed at all , and we need to go from rapidem increase and to zero . </s>
<s> this equation has four factors . you have this thing on the left -- co2 -- you have this thing left to zero , and that &apos;s given by the number of people who use every human being on average , the average energy for everybody service every single service and the co2 that &apos;s going on on an energy system . </s>
<s> so let &apos;s look at each factor and think of how we get it to zero . </s>
<s> maybe one of these numbers needs to get very close to zero . </s>
<s> now this is basic algebra , but let &apos;s go through it . </s>
<s> we have the population first . </s>
<s> today , 6,8 billion people . </s>
<s> and it &apos;s schreitet over to nine billion to move to nine billion . </s>
<s> if we really succeed with new kinds of vaccines that are gesundheitsvorsorgung and reproduktionsmedizin , we could probably think about 10 percent to 15 percent , but at times , we see a slope about 1.3 . </s>
<s> the second factor is the services we use . </s>
<s> this includes everything , the food we eat , clothing , tv , heat . </s>
<s> these are very good things and armutsverringerung means to make services available almost every one on the planet . </s>
<s> it &apos;s great that this number goes up . </s>
<s> in the rich world , in the top billion , we might be able to do abstriche and use less use , but on average , it &apos;s going to grow up more than twice , the number of services that are in charge per person . </s>
<s> so , here &apos;s a very basic service . there are light in order to read the homework ? </s>
<s> and these students don &apos;t have it , so go out and read their schulaufgaben underneath the straßenlicht . </s>
<s> well , efficiency , the e , the energy per service , there &apos;s some good news . </s>
<s> we have something that can &apos;t get up . </s>
<s> so , due to different successes in lichtsektor , through the other autotypen , through new autotypen , there are many services that give some individual services to 90 percent . </s>
<s> in other services , like the manufacturing of düngemitteln , 105 00 : 05 -- &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; / the luftverkehr or a luftverkehr , it &apos;s a lot of small for improvements . </s>
<s> in general , if we &apos;re optimistic , we might be able to reduce a factor of three or maybe even about a factor . </s>
<s> but for the first three factors , we &apos;ve gone from 26 billion to maybe allerbestes 13 billion tons , and that &apos;s not enough . </s>
<s> so let &apos;s take a look at the fourth factor of -- and this one will be a key -- that &apos;s the amount of co2 that &apos;s going on on an energy system . </s>
<s> it &apos;s the question of if you can get that to zero . </s>
<s> if they burn coal , no . </s>
<s> if they burn natural gas , no . </s>
<s> almost any herstellungsmethode for power today is co2 , except renewables and nuklearenergie . </s>
<s> so what we need to do on a global scale is to create a new system . </s>
<s> we need energiewunder . </s>
<s> now if i don &apos;t use the word &quot; wonder , &quot; i don &apos;t mean the impossible . </s>
<s> the microprocessor is a miracle . the computer is a miracle . </s>
<s> the internet and its services is a miracle . </s>
<s> people here have contributed to the development of many of these miracles . </s>
<s> and usually , there &apos;s no excuse that you need a miracle to a specific date . </s>
<s> normally , you &apos;re kind of just wrong , and you can &apos;t . </s>
<s> but in this case , we have to give vollgas and get a miracle in very short times . </s>
<s> so , i wonder , how can i really get that to ? </s>
<s> is there any natural illustration , an observation that &apos;s going to run the idea of people here ? </s>
<s> i remembered my last year when i got mosquitos , and somehow , people liked it . </s>
<s> the idea , for them , was really tangible , you know , there are people who live with mosquitos . </s>
<s> and for energy , this is what i noticed . </s>
<s> and i decided that , in addition to fireflies , it would be my diesjähriger contribution to the environment . </s>
<s> so , here are some natural fireflies . </s>
<s> they told me that they don &apos;t bite . in fact , you don &apos;t even leave the glass . </s>
<s> well , there are all kinds of spielereilösungen like this , but they don &apos;t get much . </s>
<s> we need solutions , either one or several that have an extraordinary amount and unimaginable verlässlichkeit , and even though there are many directions that humans look for , i really see five that can afford these large demands . </s>
<s> i &apos;ve left to gezeiten , geothermal , fusion and biofuels . </s>
<s> these might have a moderaten , and if you do better than i expect , that would be great , but my theme here is that we need to do all those five of these five , and we can &apos;t give them any to abdicate , because they have significant problems . </s>
<s> let &apos;s first look at burning fossil fuels , burning from either coal or natural gas . </s>
<s> what you need to do is just look at it , but it &apos;s not . you &apos;ve got to catch all the co2 that comes out after burning from the schornstein , put it in pressure , and hope that it stays there . </s>
<s> there &apos;s a number of pilotprojekte that are going to create that on a 60 percent -- 80 percent degrees , but it &apos;s going to be very difficult to get to 100 percent , and an agreement to the lagerung of co2 , is a very challenge , but the biggest problem here is the lagerzeitfrage . </s>
<s> who &apos;s going to make it secure ? </s>
<s> who can guarantee something , which literally many billion times larger than any kind of junk that you can imagine from nuklear- and other things ? </s>
<s> that &apos;s a lot of volume . </s>
<s> so that &apos;s a tough problem . </s>
<s> next , nuklearenergie . </s>
<s> it has three big problems . the costs , most importantly , in hochregulierten countries . the question for security is that you really feel that nothing can go wrong , despite the human process that the fuel is not used for weapons . </s>
<s> and what do you do with the trash ? </s>
<s> even though it &apos;s not very large , there &apos;s a lot of concerns . </s>
<s> so three really difficult problems that may be solvable , that you should work on . </s>
<s> the last three of five , i showed up . </s>
<s> it &apos;s the renewables of renewables , as they &apos;re often called . </s>
<s> and they also have -- although it &apos;s great that they don &apos;t need fuel -- they have some drawbacks . </s>
<s> one is the density density that these technologies create dramatically much lower than kraftwerken . </s>
<s> these are energiefarmen , you &apos;re talking about lots of quadratkilometern , 1,000 times more surface than a regular power station . </s>
<s> and the other thing that these sources are . </s>
<s> the sun doesn &apos;t seem all day , it doesn &apos;t seem every day , and also the wind won &apos;t go all the time . </s>
<s> that &apos;s why when you &apos;re dependent on these sources , you have to have a way of getting the energy if you &apos;re not available . </s>
<s> so there are big preisherausforderungen . there are challenges in the transmission . if we say for example , the power energy is outside the country , it &apos;s not just technology , you need to deal with the risk that the energy from where it comes from . </s>
<s> and there &apos;s the lagerungsproblem . </s>
<s> and in order to show that dimension , i &apos;ve got all kinds of batteries that are made by cars , computers , cell phones , taschenlampen , for everything . and that &apos;s what i use with the amount of electronic energy that uses the world , and i found that all the batteries we produce now are less than 10 minutes of gesamtenergie . </s>
<s> so what we need here is a big breakthrough , something that &apos;s going to be better for a factor of 100 than the treatment to go . </s>
<s> it &apos;s not possible , but it &apos;s not that easy . </s>
<s> this is what happens when you try to put these unterbrochenen vents over 20 percent -- to get 30 percent of the rest . </s>
<s> if you want to get 100 percent of that , you need an unbelievable wunderbatterie . </s>
<s> so , where are we going to go : what &apos;s the right approach ? </s>
<s> &quot; manhattan project &quot; -- how do we get to the goal ? </s>
<s> what we need is a lot of companies that are working on it . hundreds . </s>
<s> each of these five areas , we need at least 100 people . </s>
<s> in many people , they &apos;ll say they &apos;re nuts ! that &apos;s good . </s>
<s> i think in the ted group , there are many people that are already engaged there . </s>
<s> bill 1 has several companies , among one , called esolar the great solarthermaltechnologien . </s>
<s> vinod khosla invested in dozens of companies to make the great things and have interesting opportunities , and i try to support that . </s>
<s> nathan myhrvold and i fund a company that , perhaps surprisingly , tracking the nuclear approach . </s>
<s> there are some innovations in nuklearbereich , expandable by modules [postpos.] , liquid . </s>
<s> the development of this industry has stopped some time ago , so it &apos;s not very surprise that some good concepts interact with . </s>
<s> the terrapower-konzept means that instead of being a part of the urans , that &apos;s the u235 , we decided to burn the 99 percent , the u238 . </s>
<s> it &apos;s quite an insane idea . </s>
<s> but in fact , you &apos;d have thought about it for a long time , but you could never sketch in any way that it would work , but since since there &apos;s modern supercomputers , you can simulate it and see that , yes , that &apos;s what it looks like . </s>
<s> and because you burn that 99 percent , it &apos;s very much better . </s>
<s> in fact , you burn the trash , and you can actually use the waste of today &apos;s voices as antriebsstoff . </s>
<s> instead of hitting your head , you burn it . a great thing . </s>
<s> the uranium is used incremental , just like a candle . </s>
<s> you &apos;ll notice that it &apos;s a kind of column , often known as &quot; travel wave . &quot; </s>
<s> this really solves the treibstoffproblem . </s>
<s> this is a picture of a place in kentucky . </s>

<s> it &apos;s triebe u.s. for hundreds of years . </s>
<s> and if you &apos;re inexpensive and simply filtered , you get enough savings for the rest of the planet . </s>
<s> you know , there &apos;s lots of challenges , but it &apos;s an example of many hundreds of concepts we need to get forward . </s>
<s> let &apos;s think of how to measure our success . </s>
<s> what would our testimony look like ? </s>
<s> well , let &apos;s go to the goal that we need to get to , and then we talk about the zwischenschritt . </s>
<s> many talks from an 80 percent reduction by 2050 . </s>
<s> it &apos;s really very important that we get there . </s>
<s> the rest of 20 percent will be produced in the poor countries , and still something of agriculture , hopefully waldrohdung and cement will be clean . </s>
<s> so , to get that 80 percent , the world government countries , including countries like china , their elektrizitätsgeneration entirely to shift (to) . </s>
<s> the other note says whether we &apos;re using the null-emissionen technology , whether they &apos;ve been deployed in all developed countries , and we &apos;re on the way to get them to the rest . </s>
<s> that &apos;s really important . </s>
<s> this is going to be a key effect of this . </s>
<s> if we go back from here , how would 2020 look at testimony ? </s>
<s> it should contain the two elements again . </s>
<s> we should use the use of energy to bring reduction in the path . the less us to eject , the less the co2-summe and the temperature also . </s>
<s> but in fact , this note for the things that we &apos;re treating is not entirely the large reduktionen , just the same , or even slightly slightly slightly a little bit less than the other , which represents the speed of innovation for these breakthroughs . </s>
<s> these breakthroughs have to go with vollgas , and we can measure this : in upper-class circles , pilotprojekten and regulierungsänderungen . </s>
<s> there &apos;s lots of great books on this issue . </s>
<s> the al gore book , &quot; we &apos;ve got choice , &quot; and david mckays &apos;s &quot; sustainable energy without hot air . &quot; </s>
<s> they really go through it through and create a framework where this is going to be a lot of debated , because we need help from all sides . </s>
<s> there &apos;s a lot that has to come together . </s>
<s> this is a wish . </s>
<s> a very serious wish that we invent this technology . </s>
<s> if you ask me only one wish for the next 50 years , i could choose the president , i could choose a vaccine , and i love that , or i could choose this wish , that is , halbierter energiepreis without co2 , i could take that wish . </s>
<s> this has the biggest effect . </s>
<s> if we don &apos;t get that wish , the dig between the long place and the short people are denkenden by denkenden people between the united states and china , between poor and rich ländern. and almost all of the lives of these two billion . </s>
<s> so what do we need to do ? </s>
<s> what do i do ? </s>
<s> we need to use for more forschungsgelder . </s>
<s> when countries get in places like koppenhagen , they shouldn &apos;t be talking only about co2 . </s>
<s> they were going to give these innovationsstrategie , and they would be shocked by the absurd of insects that are spent for these innovative approaches . </s>
<s> we need marktanreize , it &apos;s controlling co2 , cap &amp; amp ; trade trade has something done . </s>
<s> we have to disseminate the message . </s>
<s> we need to go and do dialogue rational fraction and complete instruction and also the things that are going on by government . </s>
<s> it &apos;s a wish , but i think we can fulfill it . </s>
<s> thank you . </s>
<s> thank you . </s>
<s> thank you . thank you ! </s>
<s> thank you very much . only to understand something better -- first , can you give us an idea of scale of the scale of that investment ? </s>
<s> bill gates : so to get the simulation on a supercomputer , all the major scientists we &apos;ve been doing , we need only a few million . and even if we tested our materials in a russian reactor to make sure that it works sensible , you &apos;re only in the 100en million . </s>
<s> the hard step is to build the first reaktors , find another billion , regularien , and the place that actually build the first one . </s>
<s> when it &apos;s the first time , when it &apos;s done like this , it &apos;s very clear , it &apos;s very clear , because the economy , the density , it &apos;s so different from nuklearenergie , as we know it . </s>
<s> now , to understand this , this means to build deep in the soil like a vertical plank of nuclear brennstoffs , this tumor verbrauchten urans , and then the process starts at the top , and does the process go on and on ? </s>
<s> bg : right . so today , you &apos;ve got to befüllen the reactor forever , so there &apos;s lots of people and lots of users that can go wrong , and this is the kind of thing where you open it up and stuff hinein- or herausbringt . that &apos;s not good . </s>
<s> but if you have very cheap fuel , you can befüllen it for 60 years -- think of a column that buried them without the to show complete commitment . </s>
<s> and it &apos;s sitting there , it &apos;s going for 60 years and then it &apos;s done . </s>
<s> a nuklearreaktor , who offers a solution for waste itself . </s>
<s> bg : yeah . now , what happens with the waste : you can let it sit -- there &apos;s much less waste with this method -- then they take it and put it in the next reactor and burn it . </s>
<s> and we &apos;re starting by taking the trash that exists in these kühlbecken or trockenbehältern in their reactors . that &apos;s our startbrennstoff . </s>
<s> so this is what these reactors have been a problem , which is what we put in our hands , and that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to reduce dramatically to this process . </s>
<s> but as you &apos;ve spoken with different people of this world , you &apos;ve talked about these possibilities . </s>
<s> where &apos;s the greatest interest of doing that , right ? </s>
<s> bg : so we haven &apos;t set up to a place , and there &apos;s a lot of interesting offenlegungsregeln for anything called &quot; nuclear &quot; in russia . there &apos;s great interest and people in the company in russia , india , china -- i was here , and i talked about the energieminister and i talked about how this fits out to the energieagenda . </s>
<s> i &apos;m optimistic . you know , the french and the japanese , they have something . </s>
<s> this is an alternative one that was made . </s>
<s> it &apos;s an important step forward , but it &apos;s like a cut reactor and some countries have built this , so everybody who has done a quick reactor , a kandidatat for our first . </s>
<s> in your imagination , at a time , what &apos;s going on in your mind ? </s>
<s> bg : now we need one of these skalierbaren , stromgenerierenden things that are very cheap , we &apos;ve got 20 years to go to school for 20 years . </s>
<s> this is kind of the deadline that the umweltmodelle has demonstrated that we need to deal with . </s>
<s> and , you know , terrapower , if everything &apos;s going well , and that &apos;s a great wish , could make it easy . </s>
<s> and luckily , there are dozens of companies today , and we need hundreds of companies , which , in the same way , is if their approaches work , that can to bid [in an auction] for their pilots to do it . </s>
<s> and it would be best when it &apos;s possible , because then you could use a mixture . </s>
<s> anyway , we need a solution . </s>
<s> if the big possible breakthroughs , this is the biggest one you know ? </s>
<s> bg : a energiedurchbruch is most significant . </s>
<s> it would also have been the umweltherausforderung , but that &apos;s what makes it so much more important . </s>
<s> there are other kinds of companies in the nuclear sector . </s>
<s> you know , we don &apos;t know what these work is like this , but there &apos;s the modular method , which is a different approach . </s>
<s> there &apos;s a liquid reaktortyp that seems a little bit hard , but maybe they say that about us . </s>
<s> and so , there &apos;s multiple things , but the nice thing about this is that a uranmolekül has so much energy as a matter of energy , let &apos;s say , a kohlemolekül and why , if you can deal with the problems and they &apos;re mostly the radiation , the footprint and the costs , the potential , the impact of the country and other things , almost
<s> if that doesn &apos;t happen , what ? </s>
<s> do we need to to commence notfallmaßnahmen to try keeping the erdtemperatur rate ? </s>
<s> bg : when you get into this situation , it &apos;s like you ate too much , and you &apos;re about to be a heart attack , what do you do ? you might need a herzoperation or something like that . </s>
<s> there &apos;s a forschungsrichtung that &apos;s called geoengineering that are called geoengineering based with various techniques so that we give up 20 or 30 years to go through us . </s>
<s> this is just a versicherungsmethode . </s>
<s> you hope we don &apos;t need that . </s>
<s> some people say , well , you shouldn &apos;t be working on insurance at all because it &apos;s going to make it lazy , so you can keep eating , because you know that you &apos;re going to save one of the herzoperation . </s>
<s> i don &apos;t know if that &apos;s smart , if you have the importance of this problem with your eyes , but there &apos;s now a discourse in geoengineering about whether you should have that available if things are getting faster , or this innovation takes longer than we expect . </s>
<s> klimaskeptiker : do you have one or two sentences to go to that to convince you ? </s>
<s> bg : well , unfortunately , life will be in very different camps . </s>
<s> those who make scientific arguments are very little . </s>
<s> do you say that there are negative impacts to do with clouds that move things ? </s>
<s> there are very , very few things you can tell at all , that there &apos;s a chance in a million . </s>
<s> and this is kind of like with aids . </s>
<s> you make the mistake now , and you pay for a lot of this . </s>
<s> and so the idea is , now , if you &apos;ve got all kinds of dringenden problems to invest in something that &apos;s not so clear , the investment is not necessarily the worst scenario , and there are people in the rich world that are not sure the worst scenario , and there are people in the rich world who are looking at ipcc and say , okay ,
<s> the fact is that that uncertainty should worry us . </s>
<s> but my dream here is that if you can do it economic , and then say the co2 , and say , &quot; okay , i don &apos;t care about it that it &apos;s no carbon dioxide , i wish that it &apos;s done it , but i &apos;m going to accept it , because it &apos;s cheaper than the previous method . &quot; </s>
<s> and that would be your answer to the björn lomborg argument that if you use all of this time and energy to solve the co2 problem , the armutsverringerung , the bekämpfung , the bekämpfung of malaria and so forth that there &apos;s an awful waste of resources to invest money on it while there are better things we can do . </s>
<s> bg : well , the real spending for research -- say the u.s. government should spend 10 billion a year more than they are today -- that &apos;s not so dramatic . </s>
<s> but other things don &apos;t suffer . </s>
<s> you get too big geldsummen , and here you can disagree with reasonable people , if you have something that &apos;s not an economic , and it tries to pay it . for me , most of the waste . </s>
<s> it &apos;s because , you know , you &apos;re very much in front of a kostendurchbruch and only funds the curve . i think we should try to do more things that have the potential to be much more cheaper . </s>
<s> if the abstrich that you get , you get a very high energiepreis , you can only keep up . </s>
<s> i mean , each of us here could spend five times to change our energy without a lifestyle . </s>
<s> but for the bottom two billion , it &apos;s a disaster . </s>
<s> and even lomborg think about it . </s>
<s> now , his new masche is now , &quot; why don &apos;t we study research anymore ? &quot; </s>
<s> it &apos;s still going to be because of his former stories , with skeptiker-camp , but he understood that this is a very blank group , and therefore he &apos;s going to bring the forschungsargument . </s>
<s> and this is a test that i hold for appropriate . </s>
<s> the research , it &apos;s just nuts , it &apos;s just nuts . </s>
<s> bill , i think i &apos;m talking about almost all of the people here , when i say , i really hope your wish is true . thank you very much . </s>
<s> bg : thank you . </s>
<s> a few years ago , here at ted , peter skillman asked a design-wettbewerb called &quot; the marshmallow-herausforderung . &quot; </s>
<s> the idea is very simple . vierer-teams have to set up the maximum ball-and-claw bath structure with 20 units , about a meter of tape , about a meter of rather than and building a marshmallow . </s>
<s> the marshmallow has to be on top . </s>
<s> and , even though it seems really easy , it &apos;s actually really hard , because it leads people very quickly . </s>
<s> and so i thought this was an interesting idea , and i turned it into a design-workshop . </s>
<s> it was a huge success . </s>
<s> since then , i &apos;ve done about 70 workshops worldwide in the world , with students and developers and architects , even with ctos as a formality , and there &apos;s something about this task , which is to bring deep emotions into nature &apos;s music , and i want to share with you some of them . </s>
<s> usually , most people start to deal with themselves against the task . </s>
<s> you talk about it , you think about what it &apos;s going to look like . </s>
<s> then they invest a little bit of time in planning and an organization . they to delineate and they set up spaghetti . </s>
<s> they &apos;re investing for most of their time in the zusammenbau . </s>
<s> and finally , just before you don &apos;t have any time , somebody picks up the marshmallow , and you carefully put it on the top , step back and &quot; ta-da ! &quot; you admire your work . </s>
<s> but then , almost all the time , the &quot; ta-da &quot; is going to be &quot; uh-oh , &quot; because the weight of the marshmallows , that the whole thing will bend and einstürzt . </s>
<s> there &apos;s a bunch of people who have much more &quot; uh-oh &quot; than others , and under the worst , are fresh bwl-absolventen . </s>
<s> they lie , they cheat , they &apos;re confused , and they produce actually . </s>
<s> and of course , there are also teams that have a lot more &quot; ta-da , &quot; and among the best , is fresh absolventen . </s>
<s> and that &apos;s pretty amazing . </s>
<s> as peter told us not only produce the highest towers , but the most interesting structures of all . </s>
<s> what you might be asking is , how does that come ? why ? what about those ? </s>
<s> and peter said , &quot; don &apos;t any of the children spend time to be the chef of spaghetti gmbh . &quot; </s>
<s> they don &apos;t invest time in machtkämpfe . </s>
<s> but there &apos;s another reason . </s>
<s> and that , that bwl-studenten were being trained to find the right plan , ok ! </s>
<s> and then realizing him . </s>
<s> what happens when you put the marshmallow on the top , you don &apos;t have time and what happens ? </s>
<s> it &apos;s a crisis . </s>
<s> sounds familiar , what ? </s>
<s> what is different about it is that they are beginning to start with the marshmallow and build prototypes , successful prototypes , with the marshmallow at the top , so that they can to cobble the possibility to repair derelict wall prototypes . </s>
<s> konstrukteure recognize this kind of collaboration as the core of a iterativen . </s>
<s> and with each attempt , the children get directly feedback what works and what &apos;s not . </s>
<s> so the power of working with prototypes is significantly -- but let &apos;s see how different teams operate . </s>
<s> it &apos;s the average for most 50cm , bwl-studenten , the half of it , of the half of that , lawyers do something more , but not much , kindergartenkinder are better than adults . </s>
<s> who &apos;s most successful ? </s>
<s> architects and engineers , for happiness . </s>
<s> side is the highest thing i &apos;ve seen . </s>
<s> and why ? because you understand triangles and sich-selbst-verstärkende geometric patterns are the key to build some robust structures . </s>
<s> ceos are something on average . but here it gets interesting . </s>
<s> if you put a executive level administrator on the team , you get better . </s>
<s> it &apos;s incredible . they look around and recognize &quot; this team will win . &quot; </s>
<s> you can predict this . why does this matter ? </s>
<s> because they have special abilities of prozessbegleitung . </s>
<s> they run the process , they understand it . </s>
<s> and this team that regelt and the work will improve the performance of the team significantly . </s>
<s> geometrical skills and prozessfähigkeiten and their combination lead to success . </s>
<s> if you have 10 teams , the typical ones , you get about 6 , the robust structures . </s>
<s> now , i tried something fascinating . </s>
<s> i thought , let &apos;s put out the pokereinsatz . </s>
<s> so i offered a $ 10000 prize for the winner . </s>
<s> what do you think happened to these design-studenten ? </s>
<s> what was the result ? </s>
<s> this happened . not a team had a robust structure . </s>
<s> if anybody had built a 2,5cm high construction , it would have carried the price home . </s>
<s> so isn &apos;t it interesting that high levels have a strong effect ? </s>
<s> we repeated this exercise with the same students . </s>
<s> what do you think happened now ? </s>
<s> now , they understood the advantage of prototyping . </s>
<s> that &apos;s how it became the best , bad team of one below the best . </s>
<s> they produced the highest construction over time . </s>
<s> so there &apos;s tief-greifende lessons for us , about nature and success . </s>
<s> you might be asking : how would somebody actually invest to create a marshmallow-challenge cell ? </s>
<s> the reason is , i &apos;m helping digital tools and processes to help teams , cars , video games and &quot; visual effects . &quot; </s>
<s> and what the marshmallow-challenge does is , it helps you identify hidden assumptions . </s>
<s> because frankly , each project has its own marshmallow . </s>
<s> the challenge provides a shared experience , a common language , of grundhaltung , building the right prototype . </s>
<s> and this is the value of this experience , this simple exercise . </s>
<s> and those of you who are interested in to be able up . </s>
<s> it &apos;s a blog where you can see how to build the marshmallows . </s>
<s> there &apos;s a schritt-für-schritt-anleitung there . </s>
<s> you find mad examples of all the world , how people optimize and to refine [remove impurities, e.g. in metal, sugar etc.] the system . </s>
<s> it &apos;s also weltrekorde . </s>
<s> and the final lesson , i think , is really a verbindender sport . </s>
<s> it requires us all our senses on the task , and that we use our thinking of our thinking of how our emotions and what we do in the challenge that lies before us . </s>
<s> and sometimes a little prototype of this experience is everything that takes us from a &quot; uh-oh &quot; -- to a &quot; ta-da &quot; moment . </s>
<s> and that can make a huge difference . </s>
<s> thank you . </s>
<s> let &apos;s just do that as an engine . </s>
<s> big machine , a cool , ted-artige machine , and that &apos;s a time . </s>
<s> and everyone in this room has to be in . </s>
<s> and you can go to the past , you can go into the future ; you can &apos;t stay in here and now . </s>
<s> and i wonder what they would choose because i asked my friends in recent days , and they wanted to go all the past . </s>
<s> i don &apos;t know . they wanted to go back to the time before , before there were cars or twitter or &quot; america seeking the native . &quot; </s>
<s> i don &apos;t know . </s>
<s> i believe that you &apos;re kind of elongated to nostalgie , elongated . </s>
<s> and that &apos;s what i get . </s>
<s> i &apos;m not part of that group , i need to say . </s>
<s> i don &apos;t want to go into the past , and that &apos;s not because i &apos;m a abenteurer . </s>
<s> it &apos;s because opportunities on this planet don &apos;t go back , they go forward . </s>
<s> so i want to go into this machine , and i want to go into the future . </s>
<s> this is the biggest time that it has ever been on on the planet on the planet , no matter what scales they set : health , wealth , mobility , opportunities , declining krankheitsraten . </s>
<s> there never had a time like this . </s>
<s> my ur-großeltern died when they were 60 . </s>
<s> my grandparents committed to 70. that number . </s>
<s> my parents are 80 to the fersen . </s>
<s> so , there was going to be a nine at the beginning of my todeszahl . </s>
<s> but it &apos;s not even people like us , because this is a greater thing than that . </s>
<s> a kid who &apos;s born in delhi today can be expected to live as long as the richest man in the world 100 years ago . </s>
<s> think about it . this is an incredible fact . </s>
<s> and why is that ? </s>
<s> smallpox . smallpox have been killed billions of people on this planet . </s>
<s> they have shaped the demographics of earth in a way that doesn &apos;t ever have any war ever done . </s>
<s> they &apos;re gone . they &apos;re gone . </s>
<s> we defeated it . to go phut [coll.] . to go phut [coll.] . </s>
<s> in the rich world , diseases that have millions of us from just a generation ago are still threatened . </s>
<s> diphterie , röteln , kinderlähmung ... </s>
<s> does anybody know what that is ? </s>
<s> vaccines , modern medicine , our ability to feed billions of people , these are successes of the scientific method . </s>
<s> and from my perspective , the scientific method is to explore things , look , if it works , it &apos;s changing , it can change if it does not work , one of the greatest achievements of mankind . </s>
<s> so that &apos;s the good news . </s>
<s> unfortunately , it &apos;s all the good news , because there &apos;s a few other problems , and they &apos;ve been listening to this . </s>
<s> and one of them is that despite all our achievements , a billion people in the world will go to bed every day . </s>
<s> this number goes up , and it goes very fast , and that &apos;s shame . </s>
<s> and not only that , we &apos;ve been using our imagination to to desolate this world . </s>
<s> drinking water , arable area land , rainforests , oil , gas : they go , and it &apos;s very , very soon , and if we don &apos;t go out of this chaos , we do it . </s>
<s> so the question is : can we do that ? i think so . </s>
<s> and i think it &apos;s clear that we can produce food that will feed billions of people without the land they live on . </s>
<s> i think we can power this world with energy that they didn &apos;t . </s>
<s> i really believe that , and no , that &apos;s not a wunschdenken . </s>
<s> but this is what keeps me to wake up at night -- one of the things that stops me at night . we &apos;ve never used scientific progress as well as now . </s>
<s> and we &apos;ve never been able to put it in time , just as we can today . </s>
<s> we &apos;re at the door of amazing , amazing events in many places , and yet i really think that we need to go back to hundreds and 300 years to go back 300 years to find progress in which we &apos;ve been fighting progress in the way we &apos;ve been fighting about progress . </s>
<s> people are to drape [person] in their faith , and it &apos;s so tightly that you can &apos;t free it . </s>
<s> not even the truth becomes it . </s>
<s> and listen , everybody has a right on his opinion ; even a right to an opinion of progress . </s>
<s> but you know what they &apos;re right with ? </s>
<s> they don &apos;t have their own facts . &apos; tschuldigung , they don &apos;t . </s>
<s> and i took a little while to figure that out . </s>
<s> about a decade ago , i wrote an article on vaccine for the new yorker , a little article . </s>
<s> and i was amazed to have resistance on resistance to what was the most effective activity in humanity &apos;s history . </s>
<s> i didn &apos;t know what to do , so what i was doing was i was doing whatever i do , i wrote an article and i kept on . </s>
<s> and soon afterwards , i was writing an article about intangible food . </s>
<s> the same thing , only bigger . </s>
<s> people were playing nuts . </s>
<s> so i wrote about an article , and i couldn &apos;t understand why people thought that would be &quot; frankenfood , &quot; why you believed that molecules on a particular instead of a kind of random kind of herumzuschieben , was the domain of nature . </s>
<s> but you know what i do . i wrote the article i did . </s>
<s> i mean , i &apos;m journalist . </s>
<s> we type , we &apos;re to come down to [= reach] , we go to eat , that &apos;s okay . </s>
<s> but this article was worried to me , and i couldn &apos;t figure out why , and finally i found it out . </s>
<s> and that &apos;s because , you know , those mosques who were mad , they didn &apos;t have any fanatiker . </s>
<s> these were prudent management people , educated people , woman of culture people . </s>
<s> they were just like the people in this room . </s>
<s> and that got me so much ... </s>
<s> but then i thought , you know what , we &apos;re honest . </s>
<s> we arrived at a point where we didn &apos;t have the same relationship with progress as we used to . </s>
<s> we &apos;re talking about it . </s>
<s> we &apos;re talking ironic about this , with little quotes about it , which is progress . </s>
<s> okay , there are reasons for this , and i think we know what &apos;s there . </s>
<s> we have the trust in institutions , in authority , and sometimes the science of science , and there &apos;s no reason why it &apos;s not supposed to be that way . </s>
<s> you can just call it some names and get people to understand . </s>
<s> chernobyl , bhopal , the challenger , vioxx , mass destruction , the us-präsidentschaftswahl ice . </s>
<s> i mean , you know , you can choose your own list . </s>
<s> there are questions and issues with people that we thought that they would always have been true . so be skeptical . </s>
<s> ask , ask the evidence , demand belege . </s>
<s> don &apos;t take anything done . </s>
<s> but now it &apos;s : when you get the evidence , you have to adopt this evidence , and we &apos;re not good at it . </s>
<s> and i can say that from the reason that we live now in an epidemic of fear , as i &apos;ve never seen before , and hopefully again again . </s>
<s> it has been published a story about 12 years ago , a horrible story that brachte the autismus-epidemie with carpenter , mumps , rather than vaccine . </s>
<s> very scary . </s>
<s> numerous studies were done to see if that was true . </s>
<s> hundreds of studies should be done ; that &apos;s a serious business . </s>
<s> the data came in . </s>
<s> the data came out from the united states , from england , from sweden , from sweden , and they were all the same , no correlation , no connection . </s>
<s> it doesn &apos;t make any difference . it doesn &apos;t make any difference , because we believe in anecdotes , we think what we see what we think is what makes us feel real . </s>
<s> we don &apos;t believe in an documents of documents from a regierungsangstellten that gives us data , and i think that &apos;s what we all do . </s>
<s> but you know what ? </s>
<s> the results of this was calamitous . </s>
<s> but for this fact , the united states is one of the only countries in the world where the impfrate goes down for carpenter . </s>
<s> that &apos;s disgraceful , and we should be ashamed . </s>
<s> it &apos;s awful . </s>
<s> what happened is we could do that . </s>
<s> well , i understand that . i do this . </s>
<s> because does anyone get through ? </s>
<s> does anyone ever have ever seen anybody die of dengue ? </s>
<s> not very often happens . </s>
<s> does not happen at all in this country in the last year , but 160,000 around the world . </s>
<s> that &apos;s a lot of deaths by carpenter , 20 per hour . </s>
<s> but because that &apos;s not what happened here , we can apply it in denial , and people like jenny mccarthy can walk around and share messages like oprah and larry king live . </s>
<s> and they can do that because they don &apos;t connect cause and correlation . </s>
<s> they don &apos;t understand these things seem to be the same , but almost never the same thing . </s>
<s> and that &apos;s something that we need to learn , and it &apos;s very fast . </s>
<s> this guy was a hero , jonas salk . </s>

<s> he has just evolved with a pair of other people with a rotavirus-impfstoff . </s>
<s> it can save the lives of 400- , 500,000 children a year in the developing world . </s>
<s> pretty good , isn &apos;t it ? </s>
<s> well , that &apos;s good , except that paul walk around and talk about vaccines and say how valuable they are , and that people should just stop . </s>

<s> so paul &apos;s a terrorist . </s>
<s> if paul talks in a public anhörung , it can &apos;t tell us without armed signs . </s>
<s> he &apos;ll get calls back at home because people would like to tell him that you know where your kids go to school . </s>

<s> i &apos;ve been interested in the placebo-effekt for a few times . it might seem strange that a magician is interested in doing this , because , you think of it as i am , &quot; an delusion that is going to be a little bit more real when somebody actually believes enough . &quot; </s>
<s> in other words , zuckerpillen have shown a measurable effect in some studies , which is placebo-effekt placebo-effekt , and it &apos;s just because the person thinks what &apos;s going on with her , is a pharmaceutical biology <PB> or kind of ... </s>
<s> deception becomes something real , because somebody feels it like this . </s>
<s> so let &apos;s understand each other , i want to show you a sense of a very simple trick . </s>
<s> and i &apos;m going to show you how it works . this is a trick that is at least since the 1950s in any zauberbuch for children . </s>
<s> i myself learned it from the cub scout magic spell of pfadfinder in the 1970s . </s>
<s> i &apos;m going to do him for you and then explain it . </s>
<s> and then i &apos;ll explain why i &apos;ll explain it . </s>
<s> so , look what happens . </s>
<s> the knife that you can study -- my hand that you can study . </s>
<s> i &apos;m going to keep the knife just like that . </s>
<s> i blow my sleeves back . </s>
<s> and to make sure that nothing comes out of my sleeve , or out of it , i &apos;m just going to to compress my wrist right here . </s>
<s> in this way , you can see that it &apos;s not going to move any time . as long as i zudrücke here , there &apos;s nothing left to my sleeve . </s>
<s> and the objective of this is very easy . </s>
<s> i &apos;m going to open my hand , and hopefully , if everything comes well , the knife will be grasped through my bare physical . </s>
<s> in fact , it &apos;s in the place that i can shake it without listening the knife . </s>
<s> there &apos;s nothing going on in my ärmel or coming out , there &apos;s no trickserei , and you can study everything . </s>
<s> ta-da ! </s>
<s> now , this is a trick that i &apos;m using very often good kids who are interested in magic , because you can learn a lot about deception when you look closer , even though it &apos;s a very simple thing . </s>
<s> you probably know many of you in the room in the room . </s>
<s> it works out . </s>
<s> i hold the knife in my hand . </s>
<s> i &apos;m saying that i &apos;m umschließe my wrist to make sure that there &apos;s nothing in my sleeve , or coming out , and that &apos;s a lie . </s>
<s> the reason why i &apos;m festhalte my wrist is that it &apos;s the actual secret of illusion . </s>
<s> in the moment , where i put my hand out of you , so you see it from the back , this finger moves from here , my zeigefinger , just from where he was , in a position that he &apos;s so extended . </s>
<s> great trick ? </s>
<s> there &apos;s somebody sitting at the back of someone who didn &apos;t have any childhood . </s>
<s> so , he &apos;s right here . exactly . </s>
<s> and when i umdrehe , the fingers changes his position . </s>
<s> and now you could talk about why this is a delusion , why you don &apos;t realize that there &apos;s only three fingers in the bottom , because the mind and the way it uses information , it doesn &apos;t matter , it &apos;s one , one , two , three , but it looks as a group . </s>
<s> but that &apos;s actually not what it &apos;s about . and then i open my hand . </s>
<s> of course , it &apos;s grasped there , but not by adding my body , but through a trick , through my zeigefinger , who &apos;s here . </s>
<s> and when i close my hand , the same thing happens by the time i zurückdrehe , is hidden by this movement that the fingers zurückbewegt . </s>
<s> i take that hand away . and here &apos;s the knife . </s>
<s> this trick , you can experiences with your friends and your neighbors . thank you . </s>
<s> now , what does this have to do with the placebo-effekt ? </s>
<s> so a year ago or so , i read a study that really cut down me . </s>
<s> i am not a doctor or a researcher , and so that &apos;s an amazing thing to me . </s>
<s> it turns out this is what it turns out , if you &apos;re offering a grant against a white pill in the form of a aspirintablette , it &apos;s just a round , white pill that has a particular measurable effect . </s>
<s> but if you have the shape where you give up against it , for example , you go into a smaller pill , and you go to a smaller pill , and you shape that blue . </s>
<s> and that , even though none of apart from that -- it &apos;s just zuckerpillen . </s>
<s> but a white pill is not as good as a blue pill . </s>
<s> what ? that made me really freak out . </s>
<s> well it turned out that it &apos;s not all either . </s>
<s> if you take a to encapsulate , they &apos;re more effective than merely any shape . </s>
<s> a colored capsule , which is one at the end of yellow and the other red , is better than a white capsule . </s>
<s> the addition up is a role . </s>
<s> a pill twice a day is not as good as three pills -- i can &apos;t remind myself . i &apos;m sorry . </s>
<s> but the key thing is ... </s>
<s> that &apos;s also the dosierungen of a role . </s>
<s> and the shape is a role . </s>
<s> and if you want to have the ultimate placebo-effekt , you need to grab a needle . </s>
<s> right ? one syringe with a wirkungslosen -- a few milliliter of a wirkungslosen substance that you give up with a patient . </s>
<s> this creates a very powerful picture , and that &apos;s much more powerful than a white pill . </s>
<s> this graph is really -- i &apos;m going to show you another time , if we have an projektor . </s>
<s> so the fact is that the white pill don &apos;t go as well as the blue pill that doesn &apos;t work as well as a passenger , that doesn &apos;t work as well as the needle . </s>
<s> and none of it has really pharmaceutical biology <PB> property . it &apos;s just our belief that we made in a stronger impact . </s>
<s> i wanted to know if i could use that idea for a magic trick . </s>
<s> i &apos;m going to take something that &apos;s obviously an illusion , and let it look real . </s>
<s> we know from the study that you need to grab the needle if it &apos;s supposed to go . </s>
<s> this is an 18 inch long hutnadel . she &apos;s very , very pointy  [coll.] . and i &apos;m going to do them first . </s>
<s> this is actually my flesh . it &apos;s not damians special offer meat . </s>
<s> this is my skin . this is not a feature of hollywood . </s>
<s> so i &apos;m going to stick that needle in my skin and take it through them until she austritt over the other side . </s>
<s> if you &apos;re bad -- if you can &apos;t get close -- i put that a couple of friends last night in the room room , and some of the people i didn &apos;t know about , and a woman has become almost innocent . </s>
<s> so what i suggest to suggest if i &apos;m going to suggest , if you get very bad , then look at the next 30 seconds , or , you know what , i &apos;m going to do the first sensitive part in the back . </s>
<s> you can see it the same way , but you can also to look away if you want . </s>
<s> so , this is the same , right here , where my flesh starts , at the bottom of my arm , i &apos;m going to do a little einstich . </s>
<s> i &apos;m so sorry . does you crazy that ? </s>
<s> and now just a little bit through my skin and on the other side there . </s>
<s> we &apos;re actually in the same context that we had at the messertrick . </s>
<s> around . </s>
<s> but now you can &apos;t count my finger , right ? </s>
<s> so , let me show you . this is one , two , three , four , four , five . </s>
<s> well , yeah . </s>
<s> and i know what people think when they see this . </s>
<s> they say , &quot; okay , that &apos;s not so dumb and punctures the skin , just to talk about it for a few minutes . &quot; </s>
<s> well , then i &apos;ll show you . </s>
<s> now , what does this look like ? pretty good . </s>
<s> yeah , i know . </s>
<s> and the people at the back say , &quot; okay . i haven &apos;t seen this . &quot; </s>
<s> people in the nebenräumen are now getting in . </s>
<s> let me just show it to you . </s>
<s> this is really my skin . this is not a feature of hollywood . </s>
<s> this is my meat , and i can do the to slue [Am.] . </s>
<s> i &apos;m sorry . if you &apos;re wrong , look away , look at her . </s>
<s> the people at the back of the day , or the people who are going to see that later on video , they say , &quot; well , this looks pretty impressive , but if it was real , he would be -- see , here &apos;s a hole , and there it would be . </s>
<s> okay , let me herausquetschen a little bit of blood for you . </s>
<s> yeah , here it is . </s>
<s> so normally now i would take out the needle . </s>
<s> i would clean my arm and show you that there are no injuries . </s>
<s> but i think in this framework here and with intent to make something real , i &apos;m going to get the needle in there and get off the stage . </s>
<s> we &apos;re going to tell us a few more than that in the next few days . </s>
<s> i hope you &apos;ll be happy . thank you . </s>
<s> everybody talks about happiness today . </s>
<s> i &apos;ve made some people who count the number of books that have been published in the last five years , and they give about about 40 up , and there were a lot more . </s>
<s> there &apos;s an enormous wave of interest among researchers . </s>
<s> there &apos;s lots of glücks-coaching . </s>
<s> everybody would want to make people happier . </s>
<s> but despite all this tide of work , there are several cognitive to pass to [region, town etc.] that make it almost impossible to think about happiness . </s>
<s> and my talk today is mainly going to act with these crimes . </s>
<s> it &apos;s true for laien who are thinking about their happiness , and it &apos;s true for scientists who think about happiness , because it turns out that we are just as usual as anybody else . </s>
<s> the first one , the first one , it &apos;s a widerstreben complexity . </s>
<s> it turns out that the word is simply not useful word anymore , because we apply it to many different things . </s>
<s> and i think there &apos;s one particular meaning that we might be able to close it , but in the main one , this is something that we need to give up , and we &apos;re going to have to take the complicated view of what &apos;s well-being . </s>
<s> the second trap , is a case of experience and memory : essentially it &apos;s between happy being happy in your life and happy to be alive or happy with his life . </s>
<s> and these are two very different concepts , and they &apos;re both thrown together in the idea of happiness . </s>
<s> and the third one is the konzentrations-illusion , and this is the unfortunate fact that we can &apos;t think about a situation that affects well-being without its significance . </s>
<s> i mean , this is a real cognitive case . </s>
<s> there &apos;s just no way to get it right . </s>
<s> now , i &apos;d like to start with an example of someone who had a frage-und-antwort-sitzung produced by traditional techniques after one of my lectures , who reported a story . </s>
<s> and then he then added , really , really emotionally , that changed all the experience . </s>
<s> but that didn &apos;t . </s>
<s> what it ruined was the memories of the experience . </s>
<s> he had had the experience . </s>
<s> he &apos;d had 20 minutes delightful sight music . </s>
<s> they didn &apos;t grasp because he was remained with a memory ; the memory was ruined , and the memory was everything he got . </s>
<s> what this really tells us is that we could think about ourselves and beyond other people in terms of two types of self . </s>
<s> there &apos;s a erlebendes self that lives in the present and knows the present , able to experience the past again , but in fact , it &apos;s just the moment . </s>
<s> it &apos;s the erlebende self that the doctor anpricht -- you know , when the doctor says , &quot; well , does it hurt if i anfasse you here ? &quot; </s>
<s> and then there &apos;s an erinnerndes self , and the erinnernde itself is to get the mitzählt and the history of our life , and it &apos;s the doctor to ask the physician , &quot; how did you feel your time ? &quot; </s>
<s> or , &quot; what was your journey to albania ? &quot; </s>
<s> these are two very different units that are erlebende self and the erinnernde self and the erinnernde self , and that &apos;s part of the durcheinanders of happiness of happiness . </s>
<s> well , the erinnernde self is a storyteller . </s>
<s> and this starts really with a basic response on our memories -- it starts immediately . </s>
<s> we &apos;re not just telling stories when we do what we do . </s>
<s> our memory tells us stories , which means what we &apos;re capable of keeping out of our experience is a story . </s>
<s> and let &apos;s start with an example . </s>
<s> there &apos;s an old trial . </s>
<s> these are real patients that are going to make a painful procedure . </s>
<s> i won &apos;t go into the detail today . it &apos;s no longer painful today , but she was painful when this trial was done in the 1990s . </s>
<s> they were asked to report all their pain every 60 seconds . </s>
<s> and here are two patients . these are their records . </s>
<s> and they &apos;re asked , &quot; who one of them suffered more ? &quot; </s>
<s> and that &apos;s a very simple question . </s>
<s> the patient b has been suffering more clearly . it has been a darmspiegelung , and every minute of pain , the patient had a patient b , and more . </s>
<s> but there &apos;s another question , &quot; how did these patients have been suffering ? &quot; </s>
<s> and here &apos;s a surprise . </s>
<s> and the surprise is that patient got a much , much worse , much worse . </s>
<s> the stories of darmspiegelungen were different , and because a very critical part of the story is how it ends . </s>
<s> and none of these stories is very edifying or great -- but one of them is clear ... </s>
<s> but one of them is far worse than the other . </s>
<s> and that , the worse , was the where the pain was on its peak at its peak , it &apos;s a bad story . </s>
<s> how do we know that ? </s>
<s> because we asked these people after their darmspiegelung , and too much later , &quot; how bad was the whole thing going on ? &quot; </s>
<s> and she was much worse for a than b in erinnrung . </s>
<s> now , this is a direct conflict between the erlebenden self and the erinnernden self . </s>
<s> so , from the erlebenden self , b had an unexpected time . </s>
<s> now , what you could do with your patient is , and we &apos;ve done clinical experiments , and it &apos;s been done , and it works , you could actually do the darmspiegelung of your patient &apos;s worth by simply shaking the tube . </s>
<s> this will lead to the fact that the patient &apos;s suffering , but only a little , much less than before . </s>
<s> and if you do that for a few minutes , you &apos;ve been able to make sure that the erlebende self is a bad thing is a bad thing , and you get that the erinnernde self is a much better , because now you &apos;ve given patient a better story on your experience . </s>
<s> so what does a story ? </s>
<s> and that &apos;s true of the stories that memory provides us and it &apos;s also the stories that we invent . </s>
<s> but what a story is about , range in length from 1.3–18.5 m , big affair moments and ends . </s>
<s> end is very , very important , and in this case , that &apos;s dominated convergence . </s>
<s> now , life itself lives on the other day . </s>
<s> it has moments of erlebens , one after another . </s>
<s> and you ask , what happens to those moments ? </s>
<s> and the answer is really easy . they &apos;re always lost . </s>
<s> i mean , most moments of our lives -- and i &apos;ve got this thing to this -- you know , the psychological world talks about for about three seconds . which means that , in a month , there &apos;s about 600 million of them . in a month , it &apos;s about 600,000 . </s>
<s> most of them are completely ignored by erinnernden itself . </s>
<s> and yet , you get the impression that you should count that what &apos;s happening during the age of the world is our lives . </s>
<s> it &apos;s the limited resource we use while we &apos;re in the world . </s>
<s> and as we use them , seemingly important , but that &apos;s not the story that keeps the erinnernde self for us . </s>
<s> so we have the erinnernde self and the erlebende self , and they &apos;re really quite different . </s>
<s> the biggest difference between them is a deal with time . </s>
<s> for itself , from the erlebenden self , if you &apos;ve got a holiday , and the second week is just as good as the first week , that &apos;s the zweiwöchige vacation . </s>
<s> that &apos;s what it doesn &apos;t work for . </s>
<s> for the erinnernde self , it &apos;s hardly better than the einwöchige holiday , because there &apos;s no new memories . </s>
<s> they didn &apos;t change history . </s>
<s> and in that way , time is really the critical variable , which is different from a erinnerndes self . time has very few influence on this story . </s>
<s> well , the erinnernde self makes more than remember and telling stories . </s>
<s> it &apos;s actually the reason that make decisions come true , because if you have a patient who has two different teachers and decides how to choose what he is supposed to choose , then is the vote who has the memory that &apos;s less bad , and that &apos;s the surgeon who is selected . </s>
<s> the erlebende self has no voice whatsoever . </s>
<s> we don &apos;t actually choose by experience . we choose by memories of experiences . </s>
<s> and even if we think about the future , we don &apos;t usually think of our future as well . </s>
<s> we think about our future as vorausgesehene memories . </s>
<s> and basically , you can look at this , you know , as a tyrannei of erinnernden itself , and you can think of the erinnernde itself as one that kind of schleppt the erlebende self that the erlebende itself needs . </s>
<s> and i have the idea that when we do holiday , this is very often the case , that means that we &apos;re running on vacation with the erinnernden self . </s>
<s> and that &apos;s a little bit difficult to justify . </s>
<s> i mean , how much do we solve our memories ? </s>
<s> that &apos;s one of the explanations that is given for the dominance of its erinnernden self . </s>
<s> and when i think about it , i think of a holiday that we did a couple of years ago in antarctica , and the clearly was clearly the best vacation that i had ever had , and i think quite often about how much i think of other kinds of things . </s>
<s> and i &apos;ve probably got away from my memories of this three-week ban journey , and i would say it &apos;s about 25 minutes in the last four years . </s>
<s> now , if i ever opened the folder with 600 images , i spent another hour . </s>
<s> well , these are three weeks , and that &apos;s nearly an hour . </s>
<s> there seems to be a continuity . </s>
<s> well , i &apos;m going to be a little extreme , you know , in it , how little sorry i have on the to eat into sth. [currency reserves, savings] of memories , but even when you make more of it , there &apos;s a real question . why are we going to give memories so much weight in the verlgeich that we hear ? </s>
<s> so i want you to think about a thought . </s>
<s> imagine your next vacation , you know that at the end of the urlaubs , all of your images will be annihilated , and you get a amnestic syndrome drug so that you will remember nothing . </s>
<s> now , would you choose the same vacation ? </s>
<s> and if you &apos;re going to choose another holiday , there &apos;s a conflict between your self and you have to think about how you choose this conflict and you need to think about how you do this conflict , and this is really not obvious at all , because , if you think of it , you get an answer . and if you think of memories , you
<s> why we choose the urlaube that we choose to be a problem that provides us with a choice between the two species of self . </s>
<s> now , the two species of self , throw out two terms of happiness . </s>
<s> there are actually two concepts of happiness that we can use one of them . </s>
<s> so you can ask , how happy yourself is the erlebende self ? </s>
<s> and then they would ask , how happy are the moments in the erlebenden self ? </s>
<s> and they &apos;re all -- happiness for moments is quite complicated . </s>
<s> what are the emotions that are measured ? </s>
<s> and by the way , we &apos;re now able to get a really good idea of the happiness of erlebenden even over time . </s>
<s> if you ask about happiness for yourself , it &apos;s a very different thing . </s>
<s> this is not about how happy a person lives . </s>
<s> it &apos;s about how happy or happy the person is when this person thinks about their lives . </s>
<s> very different idea . </s>
<s> anyone who is not going to interfere with the progress of happiness , and i &apos;m part of a lot of researchers on the well-being that have broken forward . </s>
<s> the distinction between the happiness of erlebenden self and the satisfaction of erinnernden itself has been recognized in the last few years , and now to measure the two separately shown . </s>
<s> the gallup organization has a global survey , where more than half a million people asked about what they think about their lives and their experiences , and there were other kinds of efforts in the direction . </s>
<s> so in the last few years , we &apos;ve started to learn about the happiness of both kinds of self . </s>
<s> and the main lesson we think i learned has learned is that they are different . </s>
<s> you know how happy someone is with his life , and that doesn &apos;t really teach you how happy it lives and vice versa . </s>
<s> just to give you a sense of correlation , correlation is about .5 . </s>
<s> what that means is that , if you were going to meet someone and you would tell them , oh , his father is a zwei-meter-mann , how much would you know about your size ? </s>
<s> well , you &apos;d know something about the size , but there &apos;s a lot of uncertainty . </s>
<s> they have so much uncertainty . </s>
<s> if i &apos;m telling you that somebody &apos;s life as eight people have been at a scale of 10 degrees , they have a lot of uncertainty on how happy it is with its erlebenden . </s>
<s> so , the correlation is short . </s>
<s> we know something about the happiness of glücks-selbst . </s>
<s> we know that money is very important , goals are very important . </s>
<s> we know that happiness is mostly about being satisfied with people we might like time with people we like . </s>
<s> there &apos;s other pleasure , but that &apos;s the dominant one . </s>
<s> so if you want to maximize the happiness of the two species of self , you &apos;ll end up doing very different things . </s>
<s> the conclusion of what i &apos;ve been talking about here is that we shouldn &apos;t be able to think of happiness as replacement replacement . </s>
<s> it &apos;s completely a different term . </s>
<s> well , very briefly , another reason we can &apos;t think about happiness is that we don &apos;t pay attention to the same things that are thinking about life and when we actually live . </s>
<s> so if you ask the easy question , how happy people are in california , they &apos;re not going to get the right answer . </s>
<s> if you ask that question , you think people need to be happier in california when they are , we say , in ohio , life . </s>
<s> and what happens is that , when you think about life in california , you think about the difference between california and other places , and that difference is , say , climate . </s>
<s> well , it turns out that climate isn &apos;t very much important for erlebende itself , and it &apos;s not even very important for the thoughtful person self , decides how happy people are . </s>
<s> well , because the thoughtful person self is responsible , you can finish -- some people could go to california . </s>
<s> and it &apos;s kind of interesting to pursue what happens to people who go to california in hope . </s>
<s> well , your erlebendes self will not be happier . </s>
<s> we know that . </s>
<s> but one thing it &apos;s going to happen . they &apos;re going to think they &apos;re happier , because if you think about it , you &apos;re going to be reminded by how bad the weather is in ohio , and you &apos;ll feel that you made the right decision . </s>
<s> it &apos;s very hard to think about well-being , and i hope i &apos;ve given you a sense of how hard it is . </s>
<s> thank you . </s>
<s> thank you . i &apos;ve got a question for you . </s>
<s> thank you . </s>
<s> now , when we started talking a few weeks ago , they told me that there was a rather interesting conclusion that came from this gallup poll . </s>
<s> is this something that you can let us speak , because you &apos;ve got a few minutes left ? </s>
<s> daniel kahneman : sure . </s>
<s> i think the most interesting conclusion that we found in the 1950s was a number that we didn &apos;t expect to find . </s>
<s> we found that in terms of happiness itself . </s>
<s> when we look at how feelings vary with income . </s>
<s> and it turns out that under an income of 60,000 dollars a year , for americans , and that &apos;s a very large job of americans , about 600,000 , but it &apos;s a huge representative sample , under an income of 600,000 dollars a year . </s>
<s> 60,000 . </s>
<s> dk : 60,000 . </s>
<s> by the year , people are unhappy , and they &apos;re getting tired of less hands that are ever preserved . </s>
<s> we get something that is absolutely flat line . </s>
<s> i mean , i &apos;ve rarely seen flat lines . </s>
<s> what happens is that money did not catch an erlebnis-glück , but that lack of money would give you misery , and we can measure this misery very , very clearly . </s>
<s> so , in the sense of another self , of erinnernden self , you get another story . </s>
<s> the more money you deserve , the more money you deserve . </s>
<s> that &apos;s not true of emotions . </s>
<s> but danny , the whole american effort , is about life , freedom , the fight to happiness . </s>
<s> if people were taking this befund seriously , i mean , it seems to make everything on their heads , all we believe are in terms of steuerpolitik and so on . </s>
<s> is there a chance that politicians are going to take a befund like the ground and make it more politics ? </s>
<s> dk : you know , i think there &apos;s signs of the role of glücksforschung in politics . </s>
<s> it &apos;s going to be slowly in the united states , no question , but in the u.k. kingdom it &apos;s happening , and it &apos;s happening in other countries . </s>
<s> people are realizing that they should think of happiness when they think about policy . </s>
<s> it &apos;s going to take for a while , and people will discuss whether they want to study erlebnis-glück or want to study lebens-bewertung , so we need to get this discussion in a pretty short place . </s>
<s> how to raise happiness is very different depending on how you think and whether you think of the erinnernde self , or whether you think of the erlebende itself . </s>
<s> this is going to affect politics , i think , in the years . </s>
<s> in the united states , you start to measure the erlebnis-glück of the population . </s>
<s> this is going to be , i think , in the next two decades or two of the national statistic . </s>
<s> well , it seems to me that it &apos;s going to be this subject , or should be at least the most interesting political debate to pursue the next few years . </s>
<s> thank you very much for the invention of behavioral economics . </s>
<s> thank you danny kahneman . </s>
<s> i &apos;m jane mcgonigal . i design video games . </s>
<s> i &apos;ve been developing online-spiele for 10 years now , and my goal for the next decade is to make it easily as easy to save the world in reality as it is to save . </s>
<s> i have a plan for this . i want to convince more people , including all of them , to spend more time with playing greater and more tollerer games . </s>
<s> currently we spend three billion hours a week with online-spielen . </s>
<s> some of you might be thinking , &quot; that &apos;s a lot of time for games . &quot; </s>
<s> maybe too much time when you think about how many problems we have to solve in the real world . </s>
<s> but in fact , my research at the institute for the future is observing the opposite . </s>
<s> three billion hours a week is not nearly enough enough to solve the life possible world . </s>
<s> in fact , i &apos;m convinced that if we want to survive the next century on this planet , we need to dramatically increase that time . </s>
<s> and i calculated that it &apos;s a week of time at 21 billion hours a week . </s>
<s> this seems to be something that seems to be something that seems to be able to do this : if we can solve problems like hunger , poverty , climate change , global conflicts and obesity , i think we need to try to play games online for at least 21 billion hours a week to the next decade . </s>
<s> no , i mean really seriously . </s>
<s> why ? this picture describes pretty much exactly why i believe games are so essential to the survival of human species in the future . seriously . </s>
<s> this is a portrait of photographer phil toledano . </s>
<s> he wanted to catch the feelings in play , so he set up a camera before the gamers . </s>
<s> this is one of the most classical expressions in play . </s>
<s> if you &apos;re not a player , maybe some of the nuances in the picture . </s>
<s> you can probably see this sense of urgency , some fear , but also also , blatant ugliness concentration , to be delighted (with) into the solving of a really difficult problem . </s>
<s> if you &apos;re also able to play , you &apos;ve got to see a couple of nuancen here that are gezogenen up in the upper eyes , and the mouth are a sign of optimism . </s>
<s> this is a player on the edge of a so-called something called of epic proportions [postpos.] sieges . </s>
<s> oh , you &apos;re familiar with this . ok . so , we &apos;ve got some players here . </s>
<s> a epic cycle victory is a result that was so powerful that they didn &apos;t even know it was possible . </s>
<s> it was nearly beyond imagination . </s>
<s> and if you get there , you &apos;re shocked to actually be able to do something like that . that &apos;s a epic cycle victory . </s>
<s> this is a player &apos;s victory . </s>
<s> and this is what we need to see in millions of faces around the world in the world , if we take the barriers of the next century , the face of the widrigkeiten buggered  [Br.]  [vulg.] at the edge of a of epic proportions [postpos.] . </s>
<s> well , unfortunately , we see more of this face in real life if we look at difficult problems . </s>
<s> i call it the &quot; in life , i &apos;m bad , &quot; -gesicht , &quot; and that &apos;s actually my face , do you ? yes ? ok . </s>
<s> that &apos;s me , like i do in life , i &apos;m bad . </s>
<s> this is a graffiti in my former home in berkeley , california , where i study in my quest why we are better in games than in real life . </s>
<s> this is a problem that a lot of players have . </s>
<s> we think we &apos;re not as good in the reality as well as in play . </s>
<s> and i don &apos;t just mean any less , although that &apos;s what it &apos;s like . </s>
<s> we get more . i &apos;m so good at talking with motivation to do something that is more difficult , inspired to one another . </s>
<s> if we &apos;re in a spielwelt , i think that many of us are going to go to our best version , anytime and immediately helpful , to try to solve the problem of the problem , to try to solve the problem of the fehlschlag . </s>
<s> and in reality , if we fail to fail when we run on obstacles , we often feel different . </s>
<s> we feel overwhelmed . we feel ourselves . we feel ourselves . we feel threatened , maybe depressed , frustrated or cynic . </s>
<s> we never have those feelings when we play games , they simply don &apos;t . </s>
<s> and that &apos;s what i wanted to be a student student . </s>
<s> why is it impossible possible to think that you couldn &apos;t get anything done ? </s>
<s> how can we transfer those feelings from play into reality ? </s>
<s> so i was looking at games like the world of warcraft that offers the ideal environment to the collective problem . </s>
<s> and i &apos;ve noticed some things that are able to win the epic siege in online-welten . </s>
<s> so , first of all , if you get into one of these online-spiele , especially at the world of warcraft , there &apos;s a lot of different characters that are willing to anzuvertrauen you a weltrettende mission . </s>
<s> but not just any mission , but a mission that fits perfect to your current level in the game , right ? </s>
<s> so they do this . </s>
<s> they never get any job that they can &apos;t solve . </s>
<s> but always on the side of your skills , so you have to do well , but there &apos;s no unemployment in the world of warcraft . </s>
<s> you don &apos;t sit around and spin . there &apos;s always a lot of stuff going on . </s>
<s> and there are tons of employees . </s>
<s> but wherever you go , hundreds of thousands of people who work with you together to address your epic mission . </s>
<s> this is what we have in real life that are not so simple , that feeling that you &apos;re ready to be ready in a fingerschnipsen host . </s>
<s> also , there &apos;s this epic story , this inspiring history , why we are and what we have to do . </s>
<s> then we get this whole positive feedback . </s>
<s> they &apos;ve known from &quot; level high , &quot; &quot; &quot; + 1 power &quot; known . </s>
<s> this constant feedback is not in real life . </s>
<s> if i leave that stage , i can &apos;t talk to + 1 and + a (real) nutcases [coll.] idea , + 20 kooks idea . </s>
<s> i &apos;m not getting feedback in real life . </s>
<s> so , the problem of kooperations-online-welten like the world of warcraft is that it &apos;s so satisfying to stand at any time at the edge of a of epic proportions [postpos.] sieges that we &apos;d rather spend our time in these spielwelten . </s>
<s> they &apos;re just better than reality . </s>
<s> to this day , all the world of warcraft-spieler have spent 5,93 million years to solve the virtual problems of azeroth . </s>
<s> that &apos;s not necessarily bad . </s>
<s> it sounds nasty . </s>
<s> but to see it in the context , 5,93 million years ago , we began to go upright . </s>
<s> so the first steady primate . </s>
<s> ok , so if we talk about how much time we spend with play right now , it only makes sense when to think of the scale of the human development of human development . </s>
<s> but also , because it turns out that by using all this time on play , we actually change what we are as humans . </s>
<s> we &apos;re developing to collaborative minds , in nature . </s>
<s> that &apos;s the truth . that &apos;s what i believe . </s>
<s> if you look at this really interesting statistic that was published by a researcher at carnegie mellon university , the average young person , in a country with huge spielkultur , spent 10,000 hours of online-spielen 10,000 hours . </s>
<s> so 10,000 hours is a really interesting number of reasons , for two reasons . </s>
<s> first of all , for children in the united states , 10.080 hours are the correct gesamtzeit that they spend in school , from the fifth class to high school -- if you never miss . </s>
<s> so what we &apos;ve done here is we &apos;ve got a complete parallelbildungsweg where young people learn the same way , which means to be a good player , like everything else in their school . </s>
<s> and maybe some of you have the new book of malcolm gladwell , &quot; überflieger , &quot; read . </s>
<s> so you know his theory of success , the theory of the 10,000 hours . </s>
<s> it &apos;s based on the great research of kognitivwissenschaft that when we spend 10,000 hours with the mühsamen study of any subject to the 21st year , we become to master . </s>
<s> we &apos;re going to do so good at doing what the most famous people in the world . </s>
<s> so what we &apos;ve got here is a complete generation of young people who are meister-spieler . </s>
<s> so the big question is , &quot; what exactly are the players doing ? &quot; </s>
<s> because if we could figure that out , we would never have been able to do this gewesenes human potential . </s>
<s> so for so many people , we have right now in the world who spend at least one hour per day . </s>
<s> these are our meister-spieler . 500 million people who are extraordinarily good in something . </s>
<s> and in the next decade we have another billion players that are extraordinarily good in whatever . </s>
<s> you know , if you haven &apos;t heard it . </s>
<s> the spieleindustrie developed konsolen that save energy and work on mobilfunknetzen , instead of the breitband-internet , so players around the world , especially in india , china , brazil can play online . </s>
<s> you expect an extra billion players in the next decade . </s>
<s> so we have 1.5 billion players in total . </s>
<s> so i started thinking about what it &apos;s like to master us about these games . </s>
<s> here &apos;s the four things that i found . first of all , dringlichkeits-optimismus . </s>
<s> ok , think of it like extreme selbstmotivierung . </s>
<s> dringlichkeits-optimismus is the desire to do something at the same time , a prediction , with that belief that we have an begründete hope . </s>
<s> players always believe that a epic cycle victory is possible , and it &apos;s always worth trying to do it , and it &apos;s the same . </s>
<s> player don &apos;t sit around . </s>
<s> player are masters of spiders . </s>
<s> there &apos;s been a lot of interesting studies that show that we make people more after we played with them even when they defeated us . </s>
<s> the reason for that is that it requires a lot of trust to play with someone . </s>
<s> we &apos;re trust that somebody spend time with us that the rules are going to be adhered to that we have the same goal and the spielende . </s>
<s> so , the to collude allows the rise of ties and trust and with each other . </s>
<s> as a result , we &apos;re generating stronger social relationships . </s>
<s> blessed ignorance productivity . fantastic ! </s>
<s> you know , there &apos;s a reason why the durchschnitts-word durchschnitts-word is playing 22 hours a week , sort of as teilzeitjob . </s>
<s> the reason is that , if we play , we &apos;re actually getting happier to work hard than if we don &apos;t do anything . </s>
<s> we know that as human beings work properly , if we do hard , meaningful work . </s>
<s> and gamers are always ready to work hard when they get the right job . </s>
<s> and ultimately , epic broadness . </s>
<s> player love it to become part of gebietender missionen . </s>
<s> here &apos;s a hintergrundinformation here in order to put that in the right light , and you know all the wikipedia , the world &apos;s largest wiki . </s>
<s> the second biggest wiki of the world , with almost 80,000 einträgen , is the world of warcraft wiki . </s>
<s> there are five million people spent it every month . </s>
<s> you &apos;ve divided more information about the world of warcraft on the internet than any other web in any world &apos;s wiki . </s>
<s> they create a epic story . </s>
<s> they create a epic broadness source of knowledge about the world of warcraft . </s>
<s> ok , so these are four superpowers that lead to a single outcome . players are super-mächtige , hopeful individuals . </s>
<s> it &apos;s people who believe that they can change the world as individual . </s>
<s> and the only problem is you think you &apos;re going to change the virtual worlds , but not the real ones . </s>
<s> this is the problem i &apos;m trying to solve . </s>
<s> edward castronova is a volkswissenschaftler . </s>
<s> his work is brilliant . he studied why people spend so much time and energy and money . </s>
<s> and he says , &quot; we &apos;re not going to see less than a massenemigration in virtual worlds and online-spielumgebungen . &quot; </s>
<s> and that &apos;s from an economist . so it &apos;s logical . </s>
<s> and he says ... </s>
<s> not like me -- i develop games , i &apos;m kind of abundant . </s>
<s> so what he says is that actually makes sense of making sense , because players can achieve more in online-welten than they live in real life . </s>
<s> they can be creative in play than much in games than living in real life . they get more feedback and rewards in games than in real life . </s>
<s> so , he says it &apos;s perfectly logical to say that players spend more time in the virtual world than real . </s>
<s> i &apos;ll just agree that this is logical . </s>
<s> but it &apos;s definitely not rocket science . </s>
<s> we need to start turning the real world into a game . </s>
<s> my inspiration comes from an event that zurückliegt 2,500 years . </s>
<s> there &apos;s this ancient cube , from Iraq . you know ? </s>
<s> before that fantastic spielecontrollern , there were schafsknöchel . </s>
<s> and that was kind of the first of these people that were spielgeräte . </s>
<s> and if you &apos;re familiar with the web of the old greek historikers , you may know this story . the story about how games were invented . </s>
<s> in the kingdom , games were spiele , rather würfelspiele , in the kingdom of lydien during an famine . </s>
<s> if you had such famine , the king of lydien decided to a crazy idea . </s>
<s> people were suffering suffering . people were trying to struggle . </s>
<s> it was an extraordinary situation . you needed an extreme solution . </s>
<s> so they came up with the according to the Vatican , the würfelspiel , the vereinbarten and vereinbarten a national strategy . one day you would eat . the next day you would play . </s>
<s> and they would be so much in the würfelspiel , because games are so fascinating , and us with befriedigender , glückseliger productivity surrounded that they would forget that there was nothing to eat . </s>
<s> and then , the next day you would play , and the next day you would eat . </s>
<s> and they survived that famine , they kept those famine for 18 years , they were eating for a day . </s>
<s> so , i think we &apos;ll play games today . </s>
<s> we &apos;re going to play games to get the suffering of the physical world . </s>
<s> we &apos;re going to play games to make sure that in the real world doesn &apos;t work in real life , and we get what we need to play . </s>
<s> but that doesn &apos;t have to be the end . </s>
<s> this is exciting stuff . </s>
<s> for 18 years , the famine was never better . so the king , the last würfelspiel anzusetzen . </s>
<s> they shared the kingdom in two camps . </s>
<s> they were playing a würfelspiel , and the best they were getting to an of epic proportions [postpos.] adventure . </s>
<s> they left lydien , and they were looking for the search for a new home . they just left so many people out how to survive food and were looking for the rest of an area where they could flourish . </s>
<s> this sounds crazy , right ? </s>
<s> but recent dna-beweise shows that the etrusker , who were later for the burning wealthy , the same dna with the old dna . </s>
<s> so scientists recently came to the mindset that herodotus &apos; &quot; insane history came . &quot; </s>
<s> and geologists found evidence of a global abkühlung , which could explain famine for almost 20 years . </s>
<s> so , this crazy story could be true . </s>
<s> you may have saved your people by playing by playing for 18 years and then this view is encouraged by in games by 18 years and then a lot of people who learned that they &apos;ve saved the entire civilization . </s>
<s> so , we can do that . </s>
<s> we &apos;ve been playing since 1994 . </s>
<s> this was the first ever strategiespiel thing in the world of warcraft-serie . it was 16 years ago . </s>
<s> they were spielten for 18 years , we &apos;ve been playing atlas for 16 years . </s>
<s> i &apos;m saying we &apos;re ready to play for our own Epic theatre [Br.] game . </s>
<s> so , they sent half of their civilization to go for a new world . so i &apos;m going to take my 21 billion spielstunden a week . </s>
<s> in fact , we should to agree on that half of us spend a day with games a day until we solved the world &apos;s problems . </s>
<s> and i know you &apos;re going to ask , &quot; how do we solve problems of the physical world ? &quot; and that &apos;s the question that i &apos;ve been doing on the last few years . </s>
<s> we have this flag in the palo alto , in palo alto , just the way we should understand the future . </s>
<s> we don &apos;t want to try to say the future . </s>
<s> what we want to do is create the future . </s>
<s> we want to think of the best possible way , and then empower people to make this idea in reality . </s>
<s> we &apos;re going to ask our best siege and give people the opportunities to get them . </s>
<s> and i &apos;m going to share with you three games that i &apos;ve been designing to try and to try to get people to epic broadness in their own future . </s>
<s> this is &quot; no oil . &quot; </s>
<s> the game is in 2007 . </s>
<s> it &apos;s an issue where they have to overcome a ölknappheit . </s>
<s> it &apos;s been invented , but it &apos;s been invented , but it &apos;s got to be realistic to tell you how to live . so , if you start to go to the game , you can tell us where to live . and then you get nachrichten-filme in real time , how much oil is dead , and you have to figure out how to do their real
<s> we test this game with 1,700 players in 2007 , and we &apos;ve been covering it since the last three years . </s>
<s> and i can tell you , it was a transformative experience . </s>
<s> nobody wants to change his life because it &apos;s good for the environment , because we should . </s>
<s> but if you &apos;re in an online adventure and say , &quot; we &apos;re the oil . &quot; </s>
<s> this is an amazing adventure you can go on . </s>
<s> find out how they would survive . most of our players have the spiel habits on the game . </s>
<s> so for the next weltrettende game , we have a greater , higher aim to set up . </s>
<s> we developed the game &quot; superstruct &quot; at the institute of the future . </s>
<s> starting is the computing of an supercomputers that people have left on the planet for 23 years . </s>
<s> this supercomputer is called &quot; global aussterbungs- sensibilisierungs-system , &quot; of course . </s>
<s> the call of gamers &apos; call , anzumelden , we &apos;ve made almost a &quot; jerry-bruckheimer &quot; -film . </s>
<s> you know jerry bruckheimer-filme , where the &quot; dream-team &quot; exists . you &apos;ve got the astronauts , the scientists , the ex-sträfling , the ex-sträfling and the rest , you can save the world . </s>
<s> but in our game , instead of only five people , we say , everybody &apos;s in the office business , and it &apos;s our job , the future for energy , food , health , security and the future of social justice . </s>
<s> 8,000 players spent the game for eight weeks . </s>
<s> they found 500 creative solutions that they can tell when they google &quot; superstruct . &quot; </s>
<s> and the last game we get out on the third of march . it &apos;s a game in collaboration with the world bank . </s>
<s> if you finish the game , you get the award of &quot; social umgestalter , &quot; from 2010 . </s>
<s> we &apos;re working with universities across sub-saharan africa and store to learn social to metamorphose . </s>
<s> we have a comic book . we &apos;ve got to understand &quot; level high &quot; for regional advisory office , wissensvernetzung , sustainability , vision and einfallsreichtum . </s>
<s> i &apos;d like to invite you all to share this game with young people everywhere around the world , especially in entwicklungsgebieten that benefit from their own social enterprises to save the world . </s>
<s> i go to the end . </s>
<s> i want to ask you . </s>
<s> what do you think happens next ? </s>
<s> we have all these fantastic gamers , we have games that show us what we can do , but we haven &apos;t saved the real world . </s>
<s> well , i hope you agree that you agree with me that players are human resources that we can use to work in real life , and that games have a huge meaning for change . </s>
<s> we &apos;ve got all of these superpowers , blessed ignorance productivity , the ability to be creative , tight social nets , dringlichkeits-optimismus and demand . </s>
<s> and i really hope that we play meaningful games to survive on this planet to survive in this planet . </s>
<s> and i hope you &apos;re going to design and play with me . </s>
<s> if i &apos;m going into the next decade , i &apos;m sure if i &apos;m going into the next decade , that we can create any vorstellbare future , and we can play all kinds of games . </s>

<s> and the human ability to adapt -- this is an interesting story , because people will always ask me to talk about how i was with widrigkeiten umgehe and i &apos;m always going to be very uncomfortable with this sentence for me , and i &apos;ve always felt very uncomfortable to solve the questions of people , and i think i can understand why . </s>
<s> this sentence of umgang lives with widrigkeiten lives on the idea that success or happiness depends on a challenge without being a challenge without being a challenge where my life would be so successful , because i could deal with the possible possible of a life with a prosthesis , or whatever people with me with my disability . </s>

<s> we should not to depreciate or deny those herausfordernden times , and we shouldn &apos;t try to avoid them , nor to go through the rug , but it &apos;s about seeing it in the widrigkeiten opportunities . </s>
<s> it &apos;s something that i &apos;m thinking about to make sure that we don &apos;t necessarily have to get rid of widrigkeiten , but that we &apos;re open to to embosom them to put them on the schopf and use it to use a kampf-ausdruck and maybe not dancing with it . </s>
<s> and maybe we &apos;re able to see widrigkeiten as something natural , stimmiges and useful and feel like that by their presence . </s>

<s> maybe 10 times . </s>
<s> i mean , do you think , if antonio damasio asks your sense , you think about the bacteria ? </s>
<s> our gut is a wonderful gastfreundlichen environment for these bacteria . </s>

<s> and very important , with the introduction of sexual reproduction that are attracted the genome , the rest of the body is dispensable . </s>
<s> in fact , in fact , you could say that the unausweichlichkeit of death of our body is equal to equal to the same moment . </s>

<s> &quot; that &apos;s wonderful , &quot; says george , &quot; i &apos;ll take the soup . &quot; </s>
<s> i came to the realization of a physician , that i was a goal that i had a goal that was different than the goal of evolution -- not necessarily . </s>
<s> i tried to keep the body . </s>
<s> i wanted to keep ourselves alive . </s>
<s> i wanted to rebuild health for disease . </s>
<s> i wanted to make us live long and healthy lives . </s>
<s> evolution is the next generation of the genome to the next generation , anpassung and to live out [Am.] generation . </s>
<s> so , from an evolutionary standpoint , you are , and i &apos;ve developed like booster rockets to send the genetic fracht into the next stage of the orbit to go to the sea . </s>
<s> i think that we would all understand the mood of woody all the time when he said , &quot; i don &apos;t want to get any immortality through my work . </s>
<s> i want to do it by not dying . &quot; </s>
<s> evolution doesn &apos;t necessarily mean the longest of life . </s>
<s> it unincorporated not necessarily the biggest , the strongest or the fastest , and not even the brightest . </s>
<s> evolution priviligiert the creatures that adapt best to their environment . </s>
<s> it &apos;s not a test of survival and success . </s>
<s> on the bottom of the ocean , there are bacteria that are thermophilic , and it makes the hot hole survive any longer if fish were there , they would have made vacuum available fish , yet they managed to make a bewohnbare environment . </s>
<s> so what does that mean when we look back at what &apos;s happening in evolution , and how we think about the space of people in evolution , and before we think about the space of people in the next phase , i would say that there &apos;s a lot of possibilities . </s>
<s> the first one is that we &apos;re not going to move forward . </s>
<s> we &apos;ve reached some sort of balance . </s>
<s> and the reason for that is that it was for us to think about medicine , we &apos;ve been able to get a lot of genes that would otherwise be rausgewählt and removed from the population . </s>
<s> and second of all , we as a species that we &apos;ve been able to make our environment so much that we &apos;ve been able to adapt to us and adapt to them . </s>
<s> and by the way , we go around and manage and mix so much that they can &apos;t even say that isolation are necessary , for evolution , for evolution . </s>
<s> second possibility is that it &apos;s going to be an evolution of the traditional species , of course , by the forces of nature . </s>
<s> and the argument , here would be the wheels of evolution slowly , but they &apos;re adamant . </s>
<s> and so , the isolation goes away as a species of distant planets , and it &apos;s going to give birth and changes of the environment that could produce evolution in natural ways . </s>
<s> but there &apos;s a third opportunity , a tempting prospects , fascinating , scary way . </s>
<s> i call it neo-evolution -- the new development that &apos;s not just natural , but it &apos;s led to us as individuen. to decisions we make . </s>
<s> now how could this happen ? </s>
<s> how could it be possible to do that ? </s>
<s> let &apos;s think of the reality that people today do their offspring on their offspring . </s>
<s> they &apos;re , in some cultures , the choices to have more men than women . </s>
<s> it &apos;s not necessarily good for society , but it &apos;s what the individual and the family choose . </s>
<s> so if you think it &apos;s not possible to choose the gender of your child &apos;s gender , but also to make genetic adaptations on the body that would cure and prevent disease . </s>
<s> what if they could make the genetic changes in order to remove diabetes or alzheimer &apos;s disease or eliminate the decrease of cancer or schlaganfälle . </s>
<s> would they not want to make these changes in their genes ? </s>
<s> if we to look ahead , that kind of changes will be increasingly possible . </s>
<s> the human genome project began in 1990 , and it took us 13 years . </s>
<s> it cost 2,7 billion dollars . </s>
<s> in 2004 , when it was done in 2004 , they could do the same for 20 million dollars in in it / them . </s>
<s> today , you can have a sequence of the three billion base base base base of the human genome to a price of about $ $ to complete . </s>
<s> it &apos;s not going to take for a long time until the reality is going to be going to be the $ 1,000 human genomes , and it &apos;s going to be increasingly available to everybody . </s>

<s> in berkeley , we call these robots exoskelette . </s>
<s> they &apos;re nothing other than something that they put in the morning , and it gives you extra power , and that will give you more additional power , and that &apos;s going to help them to hold their balance . </s>
<s> this is actually the real verschmelzung of man and machine . </s>
<s> but it &apos;s not just the way they do in it , and they connect with the universe and other devices out there . </s>
<s> it &apos;s not just a crazy idea . </s>
<s> now to show you what we &apos;re working on now , we start talking about the american soldiers that &apos;s wearing the average about 100 pounds on its backs , and it &apos;s the urge that they should carry more equipment . </s>
<s> of course , this leads to some major komplikationen -- rückenverletzungen , 30 percent of it -- chronic rückenverletzungen . </s>
<s> so we thought that we would embrace this challenge and create an exoskelett that would help us with this problem . </s>
<s> so let me introduce to you now -- or the human universal load is carrier . </s>
<s> soldier : so with the hulc-exoskelett , i can wear 200 pounds of over verschiedenartiges terrain , for many hours long . </s>
<s> his very flexible design allows it to go deep , to sit around and have highly wendige movement . </s>
<s> it feels what i want to do where i want to go , and then raise my strength and resilience . </s>
<s> we &apos;re at the end , with our industriepartner this device , this new exoskelett exoskelett in this year . </s>
<s> so it &apos;s true . </s>
<s> now let &apos;s look at our rollstuhlfahrer , something that i &apos;m particularly passionate about . </s>
<s> there are 55 million people in the world , in the world . </s>
<s> that &apos;s about one percent of the population . </s>
<s> and this is indeed an conservative estimate . </s>
<s> we &apos;re often talking about a lot of very young people who are in the blütezeit of their life -- &apos; 20s , 30s , ages -- the fate and the wheelchair is the only option . </s>
<s> but it &apos;s also about the aging population , the number of multiplied . </s>
<s> and pretty much the only option -- if it comes to a hirnschlag , it &apos;s a wheelchair . </s>
<s> and so , by the way , it &apos;s been for 500 years since he , i must say , is very successful introduction . </s>
<s> so what we thought is that we could start to write a whole new chapter in the field of mobility . </s>
<s> now , let me introduce to you now that by amanda boxtel , which is carried by amanda boxtel , who did not have a rückenmarksverletzung , which has been able to go to the conclusion that they couldn &apos;t run more than 19 years ago . </s>
<s> thank you . </s>
<s> like i said , amanda contributes our elegs . </s>
<s> it has sensors . </s>
<s> his entirely non-invasiven sensors in crutches , the signals to resend to our onboard-computer , which is attached to their backs . </s>
<s> this is also batteriepackungen , the motorantrieb is on your knees , as well as to your kniegelenken , they move forward in this fairly geschmeidigen and very natural gait . </s>
<s> i was 24 years old , and i was in bestform , as a kind of monströser purzelbaum while he was paralysierte me . </s>
<s> in a fraction of a second , i lost each feeling and every movement underneath my beckens . </s>
<s> not for a long time , a doctor in my krankenzimmer and he said , &quot; amanda , you &apos;ll never go again . &quot; </s>
<s> and this is 19 years ago . </s>
<s> he makes an innocent hope from my consciousness . </s>
<s> adaptive development technologies have been told me to learn how to go back again , to climb up , to climb up and even go to the hands . </s>
<s> but nothing has been invented to go back to me . </s>
<s> thank you . </s>
<s> as you can see , we have the technology , we have the platforms to meet us and discuss with them . </s>
<s> it &apos;s in our hands , and we have this potential to change life from future generations -- not just for the soldiers , or amanda and rollstuhlfahrer and all of them , but for everybody . </s>
<s> thank you . </s>
<s> home in new york , i &apos;m a director of the entwicklungsabteilung of a non-profit called robin hood . </s>
<s> if i don &apos;t raise poverty , i bekämpfe as gehilfe of a feuerwehr-hauptmanns with a volunteer löschzug . </s>
<s> now , in our city , where the volunteers , in the volunteers , gave up a highly trained employee berufsfeuerwehr , you need to be pretty early on the brandstelle to be able to to get involved (in) . </s>
<s> i remember my first fire . </s>
<s> i was the second volunteer volunteer , so i got really good opportunities to be in . </s>
<s> but it was still a race against the other volunteers to get hauptmann and figure out what would be our tasks . </s>
<s> when i found out that he had a very serious conversation with the hausbesitzerin , which was certainly one of the worst days of her life . </s>
<s> it was in the middle of the night , and she was standing in the schlafanzug and barefoot underneath a screen out in the strömenden rain while her house was in flames . </s>
<s> the other volunteers that came up from me -- let &apos;s call him lex luther -- reached the hauptmann prize as a first , and was asked to go into the house and save the dog &apos;s dog . </s>
<s> the dog ! i was lost . </s>
<s> there was some lawyer or vermögensverwalter who could tell the rest of his life that could tell people that he could go into a burning sensation in the tongue house to save living creatures only because it was five seconds faster than i am . </s>
<s> well , i was the next one . </s>
<s> the hauptmann winkte me . </s>
<s> he said , &quot; hallucinations , you have to go to the house . </s>
<s> they have to go up , go to the fire , and have to get some shoes . &quot; </s>
<s> i swear it . </s>
<s> now , not exactly what i thought i had , but i was going to go to -- the stairs , the hallway , along the hallway , coming along the hallway at that stage with to blank after in the bedroom to get a few shoes . </s>
<s> i know what you &apos;re thinking , but i &apos;m not a hero . </s>
<s> i carried my prey back to the bottom , where i met my erzfeind and loved dog . </s>
<s> we put our schätze out to the hausbesitzerin , where , not surprisingly , that got more attention than mine . </s>
<s> a couple of weeks later , the feuerwache received a letter of the hausbesitzerin , where they bedankte themselves for the authentic einsatz . </s>
<s> so , one thing about all the dangers , you &apos;ve got some shoes . </s>
<s> so in my quest with robin hood and my nebenberuf as a volunteer , i &apos;m witnessing generosity and kindness in the great scale , but i also see the madness and the muts of individuals . </s>
<s> and you know what i learned ? </s>
<s> they &apos;re all important . </s>
<s> so if i umsehe myself in this room and see people who are either going to have achieved an beachtenswerten success or on your way , i want to offer this memory : don &apos;t wait . </s>
<s> don &apos;t wait to do a difference in your life until you get your first million . </s>
<s> if you have something , you &apos;re now going to give it out . </s>
<s> feed them in a suppenküche , setting up a park in the neighborhood . </s>
<s> be a mentor . </s>
<s> not every day will give us an opportunity to save life &apos;s lives , but every day gives us the opportunity to change one . </s>
<s> so put it on ; save your shoes . </s>
<s> thank you . </s>
<s> bruno guissani : mark , mark , come back . </s>
<s> thank you . </s>
<s> i &apos;m just going to go back from a community that knows the secret of human life . </s>
<s> one place where women do the zepter , with sex &apos;s &quot; hello , &quot; and the game determines the day -- where fun is a serious thing . </s>
<s> and no , it &apos;s not like you &apos;re burning or san francisco . </s>
<s> ladies and gentlemen , their familiarity . </s>
<s> this is the world of wild bonobos in the urwald of congo . </s>
<s> bonobos are together with chimpanzees our closest living relatives . </s>
<s> this means we have a common ancestor , an evolutionary grandmother that lived about six million years ago . </s>
<s> well , chimps are familiar to their aggressivität . </s>
<s> but unfortunately , we have this aspect of overemphasized in the narrative of human evolution . </s>
<s> but bonobos are showing us the other side of the prize . </s>
<s> whereas chimpanzees from large , fear einflößenden &apos;s symptoms , it &apos;s led by ermächtigten &apos;s bonobo-gesellschaft . </s>
<s> they really come up with this , because this leads to a very sophisticated society , where lethal violence was not seen . </s>
<s> but bonobos , that &apos;s unfortunately known among primates . </s>
<s> they live in the depths of the kongolesischen , and they &apos;re very hard to see . </s>
<s> congo is a paradox -- a country of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty , but also the heart of the darkness itself -- the arena of a physical argument that has been wütet for decades and nearly so many lives as the first world war . </s>
<s> it &apos;s not surprising that the destruction of the bonobos are at risk . </s>
<s> fleischhandel and the reduction of the baumbestandes lead that you could not even fill a mirror with the verbliebenen bonobos -- and we &apos;re not sure we &apos;re not sure to be honest . </s>
<s> and yet , in this country of violence and chaos , you can hear a faecal occult blood <FOB> [Br.] laugh that the trees are appalled . </s>
<s> who are that relatives ? </s>
<s> we know it &apos;s called &quot; love instead &quot; -affen , &quot; because you &apos;ve got häufigen , your sex sex , with wechselnden partners , and the laws of social angelenheiten . </s>
<s> i &apos;m not saying that would be the answer to all the humanitarian problems -- because the life of bonobos has more than the kama sutra . </s>
<s> bonobos -- like humans -- love to play their lives . </s>
<s> play is not just kinderspiele . </s>
<s> for us , it is essential to the bond of relationships and the care of tolerance . </s>
<s> we learn trust and the rules of the game . </s>
<s> play is increasing creativity and resilience , and it &apos;s all about generating diversity -- diversity of interactions , diversity of behaviors , diversity of connections . </s>
<s> and when you watch bonobos in play , you see bonobos of human lachens , dance and of rituals . </s>
<s> play is the kitt that beieinanderhält us . </s>
<s> now , i don &apos;t know how to play , but i want to show you some unique photographs just out of the wild . </s>
<s> first of all , a ballspiel on bonobo-art -- and i don &apos;t think of fussball . </s>
<s> so this is where we see a young female and males in a verfolgungsspiel . </s>
<s> look at what it &apos;s doing . </s>
<s> this could be the evolutionary origin of , &quot; you put him in the to wobble . &quot; </s>
<s> except that i think it &apos;s more like it , right ? </s>
<s> yeah ! </s>
<s> so sexspiele are common , both with bonobos and also with people . </s>
<s> and this video is really interesting , because it shows -- and this video is really interesting , because it shows the ideenreichtum , where you bring new elements in the game , like the testicles -- and also how the game needs both trust and funds -- while at the same time , doing huge fun . </s>
<s> but the game is a formwandler . </s>
<s> play is a formwandler , and it can adopt lots of forms of some of which are kind of steady eye , fanciful , curious -- maybe to discover the surprise again . </s>
<s> and i want to show you , this is fuku , a young female , and she spielt with water . </s>
<s> i think just like you &apos;re playing alone , and we &apos;re going to go out of our inner boundaries of our inner and outer boundaries . </s>
<s> and it &apos;s this ingenious curiosity that we &apos;re looking at , and interact , and the unexpected wiring that we create are the real nährboden of creativity . </s>
<s> this is just a small vorgeschmack on the insights that bonobos give us in our past and the present . </s>
<s> but it &apos;s true also for our future , a future that we need to adapt to dramatically challenge , through greater creativity and druch . </s>
<s> the secret is that the game is the key to these skills . </s>
<s> in other words , play is our anpassungsjoker . </s>
<s> so , to adapt to a very global world , we need to play . </s>
<s> but are we going to do the best of our spieltrieb ? </s>
<s> play is not silly . </s>
<s> it &apos;s essential . </s>
<s> for bonobos , their lives are not of teeth and claws alone . </s>
<s> even when it seems not appropriate , maybe it &apos;s spiel . </s>
<s> and so , my primatenkameraden , let &apos;s give up this gift of evolution and play together together as we go through creativity &apos;s creativity and wiederentdecken the wonder . </s>
<s> thank you . </s>
<s> i want you to think of two couples in the center , in the same day , at exactly the same moment , each zeugt a baby . okay . </s>
<s> so two couples , each zeugt a baby . </s>
<s> now i don &apos;t want you to spend too much time to imagine the zeugung , because , if you don &apos;t think all the time , you won &apos;t listen to me . </s>
<s> think of it just for a second . </s>
<s> and in this scenario , you might imagine that in case the sperm has an y chomosom that &apos;s held on the x chromosome of the eizelle . </s>
<s> and in the other case , the sperm carries an x chromosome that hits x chromosome . </s>
<s> they &apos;re capable of survival [postpos.] , they &apos;re both fire . </s>
<s> we come back to those people later . </s>
<s> most of my activities , i &apos;ve got two visions . </s>
<s> underneath one hat , i &apos;m dealing with the history of anatomy . </s>
<s> i &apos;ve been studying historikerin , and in this case , i study how people are umgingen with anatomy -- that human body , animal bodies -- like it with körperflüssigkeiten umgingen , with körperkonzepten , as they thought about body . </s>
<s> the other hat i took on my work is the activist , as patientinnenanwältin -- or , as i say sometimes , as an effective lawyer -- of people who are patients &apos;s patients . </s>
<s> in this case , i &apos;ve been working with people who are körpertypen who are asking social norms . </s>
<s> so for example , i worked with people who are Siamese cat twins , two people in a body . </s>
<s> i worked with people with zwergenwuchs -- so people who were smaller than usual . </s>
<s> and a lot of times , i &apos;ve been working with intersexuellen people whose gender atypically -- so people that don &apos;t recognize the artificial male or female körpertypen . </s>
<s> and as a general idea , we can use the word intersexualität . </s>
<s> intersexualität comes in many different forms . </s>
<s> i &apos;m just going to give you a couple of examples of the possible types of geschlechtsvarianten that correspond to the male or female standard . </s>
<s> in the case , you might have a xy chromosomenbasis , and the sry gene of y chomosoms leaves the protogonaden gene that we &apos;ve all got fötalen up to testes . </s>
<s> and that &apos;s why they give the testes at the fötalen stage testosterone . </s>
<s> but because of this individual , the mushrooms lack to see testosterone , the body responds to the testosterone . </s>
<s> and that &apos;s called androgenrezeptor-defekt . </s>
<s> so , much testosterone , but no reaction to it . </s>
<s> as a consequence , bodies evolved more of the typical female path . </s>
<s> if that kid &apos;s born , she looks like a girl . </s>
<s> she &apos;s a girl . she &apos;s brought up as girls . </s>
<s> but most of the time it takes us to reach the puberty and develop their breasts and develop , but they &apos;re not going to get their period , until somebody gets to realize that there &apos;s something different here . </s>
<s> and they do a few tests and they find that instead of eierstöcken and uterus , they &apos;re instead of eierstöcken , and they have a y chromosome . </s>
<s> it &apos;s important to understand that you might not have this person &apos;s person , but that &apos;s not really . </s>
<s> women , like men , have something called adrenalindrüsen . </s>
<s> they &apos;re in the back part of our body . </s>
<s> and the nebennieren represent androgene , which are virilisierende hormones . </s>
<s> most women , just like i am -- i think i &apos;m a typical woman -- i don &apos;t know my actual chromosomenaufbau , but i think i &apos;m probably the kind of typischen -- most of women like me are actually talking to androgene . </s>
<s> we produce androgen , and we talk to androgene . </s>
<s> the consequence is that somebody like me has been exposed to a brain that has been exposed to androgenen than a woman who was born with testicles and a androgenrezeptor-defekt . </s>
<s> so gender is really complicated ; intersex people isn &apos;t just in the middle of the spectrum of gender -- in some ways , can be spread across the range . </s>
<s> another example : a couple of years ago , i received the call of a 19 year-old man who was born as a kid , who was a boy , who had sex , had sex with his girlfriend was living as a man , and he just figured out that he was eierstöcke and she had an invitation . </s>
<s> he had an extreme shape of a angeborenen nebennierenrindenhyperblasie . </s>
<s> he &apos;s got xx chromosome , and in the womb , his nebennieren changed so much that they made a male hormonumgebung . </s>
<s> and as a consequence , his genitalien male , his brain was joined , and his brain was exposed to the typischeren male part . </s>
<s> and when he was born , he saw like a boy -- nobody found anything . </s>
<s> and only when he was 19 years old , he got enough medical problems , actually , because he menstruierte the doctors that he was in the inner female . </s>
<s> okay , just a quick example of a collection of intersexualität . </s>
<s> some people with xx chromosomes develop something called ovotestis , which is eierstockgewebe from hodengewebe coated . </s>
<s> we don &apos;t really know why this happens . </s>
<s> so gender can occur in lots of different features . </s>
<s> the reason why kids with this kind of body -- whether it &apos;s zwergenwuchs or Siamese cat twins , it &apos;s intersexual -- that surgeons are often adapted to the norm , not because it was for their physical health . </s>
<s> in many cases , these people are completely healthy . </s>
<s> the reason why they &apos;re often done different kinds of surgical interventions is because they threaten our social categories . </s>
<s> so , our system is really based on the idea that a certain kind of similarity is with a specific identity . </s>
<s> so we have the concept that a woman says , &quot; is to have a female identity ; a black person says , &quot; supposed to be a african autonomy in terms of your own story . </s>
<s> so we have this awful simplifying definitions idea . </s>
<s> and if we &apos;re faced with a body that actually represents something very different to us , that &apos;s what addle-pated us in terms of these kategorisierungen . </s>
<s> so we have a lot of romantic ideas about individualismus . </s>
<s> and our nation is really based on a very romantic concept of individualismus . </s>
<s> now , you can imagine how astonishing it is when kids are born , the two people in a body are in a body . </s>
<s> where i experienced most of my excitement was the südafrikanische läuferin caster last year , whose gender was asked by the leichatlethik weltmeisterschaft in berlin . </s>
<s> many journalists call me with the question : &quot; what test are you going to do , telling us whether caster is female female female or female sex ? &quot; </s>
<s> and i had to explain the journalist that this test didn &apos;t exist . </s>
<s> we now know that gender is complicated enough that we have to admit that what nature does to us is that nature is not between us between hearing and female , or between sex and intersexual and female <f, ♀> and intersexual ; we &apos;re the ones who determine these line as of course . </s>
<s> so we have this kind of situation where , however , the further our science , we need to give ourselves so much more evidence that these categories that we &apos;ve been trying to do for severe three categories , which made very simple zuordnungen made by permanent identitätskategorien , which are a lot of more blurred than we thought we thought . </s>
<s> and that &apos;s not just related to gender . </s>
<s> it also happens about race , which appears to be a lot more complicated than our terminologie . </s>
<s> in our observation , we get into all kinds of unbequemen areas . </s>
<s> we go for example , for example , that we have at least 95 percent of our dna with chimpanzees . </s>
<s> what are we to start with the fact that we &apos;re just going to tell them through a few nukleotide ? </s>
<s> as we move our science and we continue to move forward , we &apos;re increasingly going to move into a zone of the unbehagens , where we need to notice that the simplistischen categories that we have have to be very simple . </s>
<s> we see that in all sorts of different regions of human life . </s>
<s> one of the areas that we see in the beipiel , in our modern culture today , in the modern states today , is the fight over the beginning and the end of life . </s>
<s> we have difficult talks about what &apos;s a body that &apos;s going to be like human beings , so that it &apos;s a very true living . </s>
<s> we have very difficult conversations today -- perhaps not as public as in medicine -- the question when somebody &apos;s dead . </s>
<s> our ancestors used to have been so hard to fight when somebody was dead . </s>
<s> they &apos;ve just kept a spring of a spring , and if they moved , they didn &apos;t bury them yet . </s>
<s> if you don &apos;t move any more , you &apos;ve buried it . </s>
<s> but today , we &apos;re in a situation where we &apos;re going to take people &apos;s matter of vital importance organs and want to put it in other people . </s>
<s> and as a consequence , we came to fight with the really difficult question when somebody &apos;s dead , and that leads us to a really difficult place that we don &apos;t have as simple categories as we used to . </s>
<s> now you might assume that the whole thing that was going to do on all of these kinds of people like me would be happy . </s>
<s> i &apos;m political advancing , i &apos;ve got people with extraordinary bodies , but i &apos;ve got to admit i was nervous . </s>
<s> to understand that these categories are really much more insecure than we thought , slenderises [Br.] me . </s>
<s> and it makes me numb about the democracy of democracy . </s>
<s> so to tell you about that anspannung , i need to first to acknowledge [admit, confess] that i am a big fan of gründungsväter . </s>
<s> i know they were rassisiten , i know they were sexisten , but they were great . </s>
<s> i think they were so to hang in (there) [coll.] and so strong , and so radical , what they did was that i was going to look at all of the years that i was going to look at to complete what was said musical musical 1776 , and it &apos;s not because of the music that is absolutely forgotten . </s>
<s> it &apos;s because of what 1776 happened with the gründungsvätern . </s>
<s> the gründungsväter were out of my perspective the original anatomischen activists , which is why . </s>
<s> what she was doing was a anatomic dental charting concept , and they planted it by another , which was radical and beautiful , and it was applicable 200 years for us . </s>
<s> as you all remember , our fat refused to destroy the concept of monarchy , and the monarchy based on a very simplistic concept of anatomy . </s>
<s> the herrscher of the ancient world didn &apos;t have any concept based on dna , but they had a concept of geburtsrechts . </s>
<s> they had a concept of biological blood . </s>
<s> they were the notion that people who had political power should have that political power because of the vererbten blutlinie from the president to the father &apos;s office and so on . </s>
<s> the gründungsväter wiesen of this idea , and then ersetzten it through a new anatomic dental charting concept , and this concept told that all of the people were created . </s>
<s> they nivellierten the field field , and they decided that anatomic people , the common zählten , not the differences . and that was very radical . </s>
<s> now they did this part because they were part of a aufklärerischen system in the two things that were in common . </s>
<s> democracy grew , but at the same time , science grew . </s>
<s> if you look at the history of the gründungsväter , it &apos;s clear that many of them were interested in science , and they were interested in a concept of a naturalistischen world . </s>
<s> it went away from explanations in ways , and meadows things , like a supernatural concept of power , where the transmission are based on a very vagen notion of geburtsrecht . </s>
<s> they moved to an extraordinary concept . </s>
<s> and for example , if you look at the unabhängigkeitserklärung , you speak about nature and the god of nature . </s>
<s> they &apos;re not talking by god and the nature of god . </s>
<s> they &apos;re talking about power to tell us who we are . </s>
<s> and as part of that , they gave us a concept that was similar to us . </s>
<s> and so they &apos;ve been prepared for really wonderful the world rights rights . </s>
<s> they didn &apos;t think about it that way , but what they did for us was great . </s>
<s> so what happened for years ? </s>
<s> for example , women who have the wahlrecht anstrebten , the concept of the gründungsväter , says that three things are more important than the number of difference , and they said , &quot; we should have a uterus and eierstöcke that we should not have the wahlrecht that we should have the wahlrecht , that is right on full citizenship , etc , etc . </s>
<s> and women have argumentierten that successfully . </s>
<s> next came up to the successful movement movement , where we saw people like sojourner truth that spach over it , &quot; am i not a woman ? &quot; </s>
<s> we find men in the marschierenden series of the bürgerechtsbewegung , saying , &quot; i am a man . &quot; </s>
<s> again , there are people that are different skin waves that are contributing to add in common differences with each other , again . </s>
<s> we see the same thing with the behindertenrechtsbewegung . </s>
<s> and of course , the problem is that , as we start to look at all the similarities , we need to start asking questions about why we save certain kinds of energy . </s>
<s> now , hang on mind , i want to achieve certain trennungen , anatomic , in our culture . </s>
<s> for example , i don &apos;t want to be the same rights of a fish . </s>
<s> i don &apos;t want to say that we should go away from anatomy . </s>
<s> i don &apos;t want to say that 5-jährige are supposed to be right to get their informed consent to sex or to get married . </s>
<s> so , there are a lot of three trennungen that make sense for me , and that we think i should keep . </s>
<s> but the challenge is to try to figure out what it &apos;s like and why we keep it and why they make sense . </s>
<s> so let &apos;s go back to those two creatures that have been begotten  [archaic] at the beginning of the speech . </s>
<s> we &apos;ve got two creatures , both in the middle of the same day . </s>
<s> let &apos;s imagine that one of them , maria , three months premature , so she &apos;s born on december 1 of 1980 . </s>
<s> heinrich , on the other side , it &apos;s born to geburtstermin , so it &apos;s on december 1 of 1980 . </s>
<s> because , because of the fact that maria was born three months ago , they got all kinds of rights three months to get the right einvernehmlichen to be in the right place . </s>
<s> heinrich needs to wait for all of these things , not because it has an organic age , just because of the zeitpunktes of his birth . </s>
<s> we are still finding other merkwürdigkeiten about what their rights is . </s>
<s> heinrich , because you &apos;re assuming that he &apos;s male -- although i didn &apos;t tell you that he &apos;s a male / female <m/f> [e.g. in job advertisements] -- because you &apos;re assuming he &apos;s male , it can now become a male / female <m/f> [e.g. in job advertisements] , which you can &apos;t worry about . </s>
<s> moreover , it cannot be able to be the same right in any given states to get the heinrich in all states , and that &apos;s the right to get married . </s>
<s> heinrich can marry a woman every woman in any state , but maria can only marry a woman . </s>
<s> so we have these permanent anatomischen categories that are very problematic and questionable . </s>
<s> and for me , the question is : what are we going to do , because our science is such a dramatic amount of progress in the field of anatomy that we need to admit that a democracy based on anatomy ? </s>
<s> i don &apos;t want to give up science , but at the same time , sometimes it feels like science is going to be on its overall . </s>
<s> so where do we go ? </s>
<s> it seems like our culture is a sort of pragmatic posture , &quot; well , we have to pull a line somewhere , so let &apos;s go somewhere . &quot; </s>
<s> but a lot of people caught up in a very strange position . </s>
<s> so for example , in texas , at a point , decided that to marry a man is you don &apos;t have y chromosome , and you &apos;re married to marry a woman that you have a y chromosome . </s>
<s> now in practice , people are not going to test their chromosome . </s>
<s> but it &apos;s also very bizarre , because of the history that i told you about the androgenrezeptor-defekt . </s>
<s> if we look at one of the gründungsväter of modern democracy , dr. martin luther king , he offers us in his &quot; i have a dream . &quot; </s>
<s> he says we shouldn &apos;t be able to give people &quot; their skin skin , &quot; but according to the property of their character , &quot; judge , &quot; and goes beyond anatomy . </s>
<s> and i want to say , &quot; yeah , that sounds like a really good idea . &quot; </s>
<s> but how do you do that in practice ? </s>
<s> how do you evaluate people from their charaktereigenschaften ? </s>
<s> and i also want to point out that i &apos;m not sure that we should distribute rights in terms of human beings because i have to admit that i know a series of golden retriever that &apos;s probably more effective than some people i know . </s>
<s> i want to make sure that i &apos;m probably known to some of the bright labradorhunde , the abler , the more attractive , more attractive and more interesting decisions about making their sexual relationships than some of the 40-jährige that i know . </s>
<s> so , how do we to operationalize the question of the character ? </s>
<s> it turns out to be really hard . </s>
<s> and part of me wondered what if the content of a personality would be something that would be machine-parsable in the future -- could be made by mri ? </s>
<s> do we really want to go to that direction ? </s>
<s> i &apos;m not sure where we go . </s>
<s> what i know is that it seems really important to think about the idea that the u.s. </s>
<s> in our efforts for democracy , we have done really well , and i think we &apos;d be doing our things in the future . </s>
<s> we have no idea of what it is like in iran the case , where a guy who feels sexually about other men , it &apos;s been punished by death , it is to be willing to unterziehen a geschlechtsumwandlung , which is , in which case , it can remain . </s>
<s> we don &apos;t exist with any of us . </s>
<s> and i &apos;m glad to say that we don &apos;t have those states -- a surgeon that i talked to you about a few years ago , who had been talking a few Siamese cat twins , to separate them , in part , to make a name . </s>
<s> but when i telefonierte with him , and he asked him why he did these interventions -- it was highly dangerous nature surgeries -- was his response that in his country , these children would be treated very badly , and so he had to do it . </s>
<s> and i told him , &quot; well , well , did you think of political asyl instead of an operation to separate it ? &quot; </s>
<s> the united states provides incredible opportunities to allow people to be that they &apos;re , without having to change the state of the state . </s>
<s> so i think we need to be a leader . </s>
<s> well , just to finish , i want to notice that i &apos;ve talked a lot about dads . </s>
<s> and i want to think about the possibilities of democracy , if we could have looked at mothers more . </s>
<s> and i want to say something radical for a feminist , and that &apos;s what i think there might be different insights that could give you different insights that have different kinds of anatomy , [particularly] when people are using a gruppendenken . </s>
<s> for years , since years ago , i was interested in intersexualität , i was interested in the development of geschlechterdifferenz . </s>
<s> and one of the things that i really thought really interesting about is the difference between men and women in ways in terms of thinking in the world . </s>
<s> what we &apos;ve seen from kulturübergreifenden studies is that women , on average -- not each one , but on average -- more complex social relationships and the care for people who are vulnerable in the group , are very much attention to give . </s>
<s> and so , if we think about it , we have an interesting situation in front of us . </s>
<s> years ago , when i was a graduate student , i asked one of my favorite studienbetreuer , who knew my interest on feminism -- i looked at myself as a feminist , so it &apos;s a very strange question . </s>
<s> he said , &quot; tell me what the feminism female is . &quot; </s>
<s> and i thought , &quot; well , that &apos;s the dumbest question i &apos;ve ever heard . </s>
<s> on feminism , it &apos;s about to ask to do sth. stereotypes , so that &apos;s not the female <f, ♀> of feminism . </s>
<s> but the more i thought about his question , so i thought that it could be something that could be done on feminism . </s>
<s> this is to say it might give something up , on average , the female brains of boys tell us what attentive admirer us to hochkomplexe social relationships , and attentive admirer for the schutzbedürftige . </s>
<s> so what the gründungsväter were extremely interested in trying to figure out how individuals could be protected in this concept , it &apos;s possible that if we put more mothers in this concept , we &apos;re going to be able to bekämmen more , not just how to protect it , but how to care for each other . </s>
<s> and maybe it &apos;s the way we need to go into the future where we need to think about democracy over anatomy -- less about the individual bodies of thinking about what identity is about . </s>
<s> so if we try to make as people , we &apos;re trying to make a difference connection , we think about what we can do for each other . </s>
<s> thank you . </s>
<s> i &apos;m jessi , and this is my suitcase . </s>
<s> but before i show you what i &apos;ve got inside , i &apos;m going to make a very public confession , which is , i &apos;m obsessed with outfits . </s>
<s> and i love it for every chance to get a different farbenfrohes , get crazy outfit , to be able to be able to take up and to blog . </s>
<s> but i don &apos;t buy anything new . </s>
<s> i get my clothes in the second hand on flohmärkten and in upper-class circles . </s>
<s> ooh , thank you . </s>
<s> second-hand-shopping allows me to reduce the impact of my garderobe on the environment and also my geldbörse . </s>
<s> i meet all kinds of amazing people ; my dollars use a good purpose ; i look pretty unique ; and it makes up to my entirely personal . </s>
<s> i mean , what are i going to find today ? </s>
<s> is it going to have my height ? </s>
<s> do i like the color ? </s>
<s> will it cost less than 20 dollars ? </s>
<s> when all the answers i do , i feel like i won . </s>
<s> i come back to my suitcase , and tell you what i did this exciting week here at ted . </s>
<s> i mean , what does someone do with that kind of outfits ? </s>
<s> so i &apos;m going to show you what i &apos;ve got . </s>
<s> i brought with seven few people , and that &apos;s all . </s>
<s> so , for the same week , i have everything i did in my suitcase . </s>
<s> i &apos;m sure i &apos;m sure i &apos;m going to make everything else i wanted to wear if i first came to palm springs . </s>
<s> and since she hasn &apos;t heard of me as the woman running around at ted in their underwear -- means that , i found a few things . </s>
<s> and i really want to show you this week for this week . </s>
<s> is it okay ? </s>
<s> while i &apos;m doing that , i &apos;m not going to leave you some of the lessons that i &apos;ve been telling you to believe or not , that i &apos;ve learned from that abenteuern , to have nothing new . </s>
<s> let &apos;s start with sunday . </s>
<s> i call that the strahlenden tiger . </s>
<s> you don &apos;t have to spend a lot of money to look good . </s>
<s> you can almost almost be great for less than 50 dollars . </s>
<s> this whole outfit , including the camera , has taken me 55 , and it was the most expensive piece i carried on all week . </s>
<s> monday : paint is something belter [Br.] [coll.] . </s>
<s> it &apos;s almost ironic impossible to be gelaunt if you wear hellrote pants . </s>
<s> if you &apos;re happy , you take other happy people . </s>
<s> tuesday : adapt overprized . </s>
<s> i spent a lot of time of my life trying to try and be able to be myself and adapt . </s>
<s> be just who you are . </s>
<s> when they surrounded with the right people , they won &apos;t only understand it , they &apos;ll appreciate it . </s>
<s> wednesday : hug your inner child . </s>
<s> sometimes people say to me , i thought , &quot; i &apos;ll play myself , &quot; or that i remember her . </s>
<s> and i &apos;m smiling and say , &quot; thank you . &quot; </s>
<s> thursday : confidence is the key one . </s>
<s> if you think you &apos;re looking good at something , it &apos;s almost certain . </s>
<s> and if you think you don &apos;t look good at something , you probably get right . </s>
<s> i grew up with a mother that taught me that day for day . </s>
<s> but only as i got 30 , i really understood what that means . </s>
<s> and i &apos;ll sum it up for you in a minute . </s>
<s> if you believe they &apos;re inside and the top of a wonderful person , there &apos;s nothing that you can &apos;t afford . </s>
<s> so there &apos;s no excuse to somebody in this audience here . </s>
<s> we should be able to figure out anything we want . </s>
<s> thank you . </s>
<s> friday : one universal truth -- five words , golden pailleten . </s>
<s> and finally , saturday : a personal , unique , personal style , is a great way to tell the world something about one , without having to say a word . </s>
<s> it &apos;s got me over and over and over and over again , when i came up with people that week , only because of what i was wearing . and i had great talks . </s>
<s> clearly , this is not going to fit in my tiny suitcase . </s>
<s> so before i go home , i &apos;m going to give it all back . </s>
<s> because the lesson that i &apos;m going through trying to learn this week is that it &apos;s okay to let go . </s>
<s> and i don &apos;t have to to inhere this stuff , because the corner is always going to give you another crazy , farbenfrohes , beaming face outfit that are just waiting to me when i have a little love in heart and looking for it . </s>
<s> thank you very much indeed . </s>
<s> thank you . </s>
<s> good afternoon , everybody together . </s>
<s> i &apos;ve got to show here what i want to show you . </s>
<s> think of this as bildpunkt , flying bildpunkt . </s>
<s> this is what we call in our lab , wahrnehmbares design . </s>
<s> let me tell you a little bit about this . </s>
<s> now , if you take this picture -- i &apos;m originally italian , and every boy in italy grows with this picture in his room , but the reason i &apos;m showing this is something that happened in the formula for over for a decade . </s>
<s> but some time ago , it was that if they wanted to make a formula on top of a race , they took their budget and put their money on a good driver and a good car . </s>
<s> and when the car and the driver were good enough , they won the race . </s>
<s> now today , if you want to win a race , like this one -- something that has been looking at in real time , there &apos;s some thousand sensors that share information from the car and then process this information to the system and then process it , and then use that to send back to this car and do things in real time as information . </s>
<s> this would be you , in ingenieurteams , to call [name] . </s>
<s> and basically , it &apos;s a system that &apos;s made up of two parts -- a spürenden piece and a reagierendenteil . </s>
<s> what &apos;s interesting today is , in our life , is beginning to emerge in our lives . </s>
<s> our cities have been around , in the last few years , right now with networks and electronics . </s>
<s> they &apos;re going to grow up with computers . </s>
<s> and as computers in the free , start to react to other ways , they &apos;re going to be apprehended and driven . </s>
<s> when we add cities , this is actually a really big deal . </s>
<s> but by the way , i want to mention that cities are only two percent of the world &apos;s land , but 50 percent of global citizens live there . </s>
<s> they &apos;re 75 percent of the gdp -- leading to 80 percent of co2 emissions . </s>
<s> so if we do something with the cities , this is a very big thing . </s>
<s> beyond the towns , pulling all of this sense and drive in objects of everyday life . </s>
<s> this is from an exhibition that paola antonelli for moma later , during the summer , organized . </s>
<s> it &apos;s called &quot; along with me . &quot; </s>
<s> well , all of our objects , our environment , start talking to us . </s>
<s> in some sense , it &apos;s almost like every atom is going to be out there , a sensor and a antreiber . </s>
<s> and this is really changing the kind of interaction we make people outside with our environment . </s>
<s> in a way , it &apos;s almost like the old dream of michelangelo ... </s>
<s> you know , as michelangelo shaped the moses , it means that he nahm the hammer and he went to moses -- they actually can &apos;t see a little spot of untendrunter -- and he said , &quot; perché non liquet [it is not clear] parli ? why not do you talk ? &quot; </s>
<s> well , today , our environment begin for the very first time of us . </s>
<s> and i &apos;m just going to show you some examples -- again , with the idea of our environment and power . </s>
<s> let &apos;s start with this sense . </s>
<s> now the first project i &apos;m going to show you is actually one of the first of our lab . </s>
<s> it was born four and a half years ago . </s>
<s> and what we &apos;ve been doing there , in fact , was to use new kinds of networks that have been deployed around the world -- this is a mobiltelefonnetz -- and free information and aggregierte information from the network that are now collected by the operators to understand how the city works . </s>
<s> the summer was a happy summer -- 2006 . </s>
<s> it was as 2003 the Seven Wonders of the (Ancient) World gewann . </s>
<s> some of you will remember , it was played as italy to france , and then the ende , the kopfstoß . </s>
<s> and anyway , in italy , they won up . </s>
<s> now look at what happened this day , just at the beginning of the activity that happens in the network . </s>
<s> here you see the city . </s>
<s> you can see in the middle , the kolosseum , the fluß tiber . </s>
<s> in the morning , before the game . </s>
<s> look at the timeline . </s>
<s> in the day of day , people in there , and there , are making phone phone . </s>
<s> the game begins -- silence . </s>
<s> france is a gateway . italy is a gateway . </s>
<s> halbzeit , people make a short call , go to the toilet . </s>
<s> second halbzeit . end of your normal hand . </s>
<s> first comfort , second . </s>
<s> zidane , in a moment of kopfstoß . </s>
<s> italy wins . yeah . </s>
<s> well , at this night , all night went to the center . </s>
<s> they made the great difference . </s>
<s> the next day , they all went to the center to make the siegerteam and the prime minister at the same time . </s>
<s> and then everybody went down . </s>
<s> you see the picture of the space of circo massimo , where , since the römischen time , people go to celebration -- to have a great party , and you see the ausschlag of the day . </s>
<s> well , this is just an example of how we can feel the city today in a way that we didn &apos;t have a couple of years ago . </s>
<s> well , another example of belief , it &apos;s not about people , it &apos;s about people , it &apos;s about things we use and consume . </s>
<s> well , now we know everything about where our things are coming from . </s>
<s> this is a map that shows you all the chips that a mac computers consists of , as they came together . </s>
<s> but we know very little about where things go . </s>
<s> so in this project , we actually designed some small markers to pursue the trash as they go through the system . </s>
<s> so we started with a bunch of volunteers that have been helped us over a year ago in seattle to tag the things that they wegwarfen -- different kinds of things , as you can see , things that you would look at . </s>
<s> we then have the small chips , the small brands , on the trash and start tracking it . </s>
<s> these are the results that we &apos;ve got right now . </s>
<s> from seattle ... </s>
<s> after a week . </s>
<s> with this information we realized that there &apos;s a lot of ineffizienzen in the system . </s>
<s> we can do the same things that are doing in fact with less energy . </s>
<s> the data wasn &apos;t available . </s>
<s> but this happens to a lot of unnützer transporte and more complicated things . </s>
<s> but the other thing is that we believe that when we see day every day that the cup we throw away is not simply the fact that they still are on the planet somewhere . </s>
<s> and the plastic bottle that we still throw away every day . </s>
<s> and if we were to show that people , then we can move behavior . </s>
<s> so this is the cause of this project . </s>
<s> my colleague at mit , assaf biderman , could tell you much more about this and the many other wonderful things that you can do with perceive , but i want to talk to you in the second part that we see at the beginning , and that &apos;s the betätigung of our environment . </s>
<s> and the first project is something we did a few years ago in zaragoza , spain . </s>
<s> it began with a question of bürgermeisters who came to us and said that spain and südeuropa have a beautiful tradition of using water as part of the architecture . </s>
<s> and the question was : how could you create technology to bring new technology ? </s>
<s> and one of the ideas who became a arbeitskreis ascertained , was , you know , imagine these tubes and valves , magnetventile , to clap , valves , to clap , valves and close . </s>
<s> they &apos;re going to do what they like to do with bildpunkten water . </s>
<s> if these bildpunkte fall down , they can write it , they can build patterns , images , text . </s>
<s> and you are able to approach it , and it &apos;s going to open up to get them durchspringen , as you can see in this picture . </s>
<s> well , we presented the mayor belloch . </s>
<s> he really enjoyed it . </s>
<s> and we got the assignment to design a building at the eingang of the expo . </s>
<s> we called it the digital water . </s>
<s> the whole building was made out of water . </s>
<s> there &apos;s no doors or windows , but if you approach it , it will open and let it go . </s>
<s> the roof was covered with water as well . </s>
<s> and if it &apos;s blowy , if you want to reduce the syringes , you can even let the roof lower . </s>
<s> or you could close the building and become the whole architecture , like in this case , you know , this days , when you take the roof , you get pictures of people who were there , and say , &quot; you lost the building . &quot; </s>
<s> no , you didn &apos;t lose the building , it &apos;s just that architecture almost disappears . </s>
<s> this is how the building works . </s>
<s> you see the person who asks what happens inside . </s>
<s> and this is me when i was trying to test sensors that opened the water , not to get wet . </s>
<s> now , i would tell you what happened one at a night when all of these sensors stopped . </s>
<s> but actually , it was a greater good one night . </s>
<s> all the children from zaragoza came to the building because the way they played with the building was entirely different . </s>
<s> no longer a building that would open up in order to make it like it , but a building that still breaks up and holes in the water , you needed to jump without wet to the skin . </s>
<s> and that was , for us , really interesting , because as architects , engineers , as designers , we always think about how people are using things that we design . </s>
<s> but reality is increasingly unpredictable . </s>
<s> and this is the beauty about creating things that are used and interact with people . </s>
<s> so , here &apos;s a picture of the building with the physical bildpunkten , the bildpunkten of water and the projections on it . </s>
<s> and this is what we got to think about the following project that i &apos;m showing you now . </s>
<s> think of that bildpunkte could really start flying . </s>
<s> imagine if you could have little helicopters that fly through air , and each of them with a little bildpunkt with wechselndem light -- almost like a cloud that can go through the space . </s>
<s> here &apos;s the video . </s>
<s> think of a helicopter , like the one you saw earlier , it &apos;s completely in synchrony with others . </s>
<s> you can have those cloud . </s>
<s> you can have some kind of flexiblen screen or display , like these -- a smooth formation in two dimensions . </s>
<s> or beavers , but in three dimensions , which changes what changes , the light is not the position of bildpunkte . </s>
<s> they can play with different kinds . </s>
<s> imagine the screen could just appear in different formaten or sizes , in different ways . </s>
<s> but then , the whole thing could be a 3d cloud of bildpunkten that they can step up with , and that they can move through them that can look at many directions . </s>
<s> here you see a real flyfire-steuerung , the herabsinkt , the herabsinkt , the herabsinkt , the aforetime  [archaic] . </s>
<s> if you turn the light on , it looks like this . so , as we saw it before . </s>
<s> imagine that every single one of people is being run . </s>
<s> it could have a impulse every single one that comes from people , from the movements of humans , or whatever . </s>
<s> i want to show you something first here . </s>
<s> we &apos;ve been working with roberto bolle , one of the best balletttänzer of our time -- to dally away the day at the metropolitan theater in new york and the scale in milan -- we took his movement in 3d to use them as a legal for the flyfire . </s>
<s> here you see roberto dancing . </s>
<s> on the left-hand side , you see the bildpunkte , the different eingefangenen sensations . </s>
<s> it &apos;s an echtzeit-3d-scan and a bewegungsaufnahme . </s>
<s> so you can feel all the movement . </s>
<s> you can do that all the time . </s>
<s> but then , if we all have bildpunkte , you can play with it with color and color . </s>
<s> we want to use that as a possible impulse for the flyfire . </s>
<s> let me show you the latest project that we &apos;re working on . </s>
<s> it &apos;s something that we &apos;re working on for the olympics in london . </s>
<s> it &apos;s called the cloud -- the cloud . </s>
<s> so the idea is again , if you think of this as to do something that is about to do something and to change the environment -- almost like that , we call it the way we call wolkenbewegung , how to move to be de rigueur (for sb.) , but with a cloud . </s>
<s> imagine that everybody can give a small spende for a bildpunkt . </s>
<s> and i think the remarkable one of the events of events last year , the last decades is that we changed from a source to a digital world . </s>
<s> that &apos;s all digitized , knowledge , and make it available through the internet . </s>
<s> today , for the first time , we can -- and the campaign obama has shown this -- we can change from the digital world , the selbstorganisierenden forces of networks to the physical world . </s>
<s> this can be , in our case , that we use it to design and create a symbol . </s>
<s> that means something that is built in the city . </s>
<s> but tomorrow can allow us to ask the next challenges -- think about climate change , or co2 emissions -- how to move from the digital world into the physical world . </s>
<s> so the idea is that we actually put the people together in that they bring things together together . </s>
<s> the cloud is a cloud of bildpunkten , in the same way that a real cloud is a cloud of particles . </s>
<s> and these particles are water , as our cloud is a cloud from bildpunkten . </s>
<s> it &apos;s a physical activity in london , but with bildpunkten covers . </s>
<s> you can go inside and do different kinds of experiences . </s>
<s> you can actually look at it from the bottom , the most important moments of olympia 2012 and in addition to it , and use it as a kind of connection to the community . </s>
<s> so both , the physical cloud in the sky and something of the top of them can go to the top of the city . </s>
<s> you can go . </s>
<s> and a sort of digital leuchtturm in the night -- but as allerwichtigstes , a new way to everybody who wants to go to the top . </s>
<s> thank you . </s>
<s> as an artist , i &apos;m very interested . </s>
<s> through my work , i &apos;m trying to say that people are separated by nature and that everything is connected . </s>
<s> the first time i was in antarctica , almost 10 years ago , where i saw my first eisberge . </s>
<s> i came up with awe . </s>
<s> my heart raste , was dizzily , while i was trying to figure out what was in front of me . </s>
<s> the slightest around around me was nearly 60 meters from the water , year , and just wonder that that was a snowflake on another gene year after year . </s>
<s> eisberge are born as kalb of an gletschers or by eisschollen . </s>
<s> each uniform has its own individual personality . </s>
<s> they interact in distinct ways with their surroundings and their experiences . </s>
<s> some weigern weigern and to cling [hold on tightly to sb.] up to the bitter end , while others can &apos;t withstand and to collapse in a anfall . </s>
<s> if you look at a iceberg , you think of it easy to be isolated , separate , just as we see humans often . </s>
<s> but the truth is far away . </s>
<s> during the rain , i atme his vorzeitliche atmosphere . </s>
<s> during the iceberg , it puts mineralstoffreiches drinking water , which feeds many lebensformen . </s>
<s> and i &apos;m going to go to my point of these eisberge , when i &apos;m going to make portraits of my ancestors in the mind that they exist in these individual moments of moments , and never going back like this . </s>
<s> it &apos;s not a death , if it melt up , it &apos;s not an end , but a fortführung of their pfades along the life cycle . </s>
<s> part of the ice in the eisbergen that i photographiere is very young -- some thousand years old . </s>
<s> and part of the ice is more than 100,000 years old . </s>
<s> the last images that i want to show you is a iceberg that i put in kekertsuatsiak in greenland . </s>
<s> very rarely , you &apos;re actually going to witness a rollenden iceberg . </s>
<s> so here &apos;s what you see . </s>
<s> on the left-hand side , you see a little boat . </s>
<s> this is about five meters long . </s>
<s> please pay attention to the shape of the iceberg and where it &apos;s on the wasserlinie . </s>
<s> you can see here , he starts to roll , and the boat has moved to the other side , the guy stands there . </s>
<s> this is the average size of a grönland-eisbergs . </s>
<s> it ruins about 120 feet from the water , or 40 meters . </s>
<s> and this video is real real . </s>
<s> and just like this , it gives you a different side of your personality . </s>
<s> thank you . </s>
<s> my life is really extraordinary about work in some amazing projects . </s>
<s> but the best thing i &apos;ve ever been working on was this guy . </s>
<s> his name is tempt tempt . </s>
<s> tempt was one of the leading graffitikünstler in the &apos; 80s . </s>
<s> then , one day , he came back from walking , and he said , &quot; paps , my legs to prickle [tingle] . &quot; </s>
<s> and that was an outbreak of the outbreak . </s>
<s> tempt is entirely paralyzed today . </s>
<s> he can only use his eyes . </s>
<s> i stood with him . </s>
<s> i have a company that makes design and animations , which is inevitably a complex part of what we admire in the art art . </s>
<s> so we decided we had tony -- tempt tony -- and supporting his things . </s>
<s> i met with his father and his brother and said , &quot; we &apos;ll give you this money . </s>
<s> what are you going to do with it ? &quot; </s>
<s> and his brother said , &quot; i want to talk to tony again . </s>
<s> and i just want to go back with him and i said , &quot; well , well , i &apos;m not -- i saw stephen hawking -- can &apos;t communicate all the paralyzed with these devices ? &quot; </s>
<s> and he said , &quot; no , only when you &apos;re hearing the higher gesellschaftsschicht and you &apos;ve got a remarkable insurance insurance , you can really do that . </s>
<s> ordinary people are not available . &quot; </s>
<s> and i said , &quot; how to communicate her ? &quot; </s>
<s> did anybody ever seen the movie &apos; &quot; schmetterling and taucherglocke ? &quot; </s>
<s> this is how they communicate -- so your fingers are running along . </s>
<s> &quot; very archaic , how can that be ? &quot; </s>
<s> so i came up with a need to just auszustellen a check , and instead , i made a check that i didn &apos;t know the slightest comprehension , how to to cash in it . </s>
<s> and i got myself in and place to his brother and his father , and he said , &quot; well , my proposal is like this : tony &apos;s speaking , we &apos;ll get it a device , and we &apos;ll find a way that he can do his art again . </s>
<s> because it &apos;s a farce that somebody who &apos;s wearing all of this is not able to communicate . &quot; </s>
<s> so i spoke a few months later at a conference . </s>
<s> and i met these guys from grl , graffiti research lab and they have a technology that allows you to project a light on every single surface , and then drawing with a laserpointer to draw with a laserpointer that registered only the negative surface . </s>
<s> so they go around and make kunstinstallationen like this . </s>
<s> they &apos;re saying that all things that are shown up there , they &apos;re to follow an (old) custom . </s>
<s> it starts with the organs , then the schimpfwörter , the schimpfwörter , the bush-verleumdungen , the bush-verleumdungen , the people are actually doing art . </s>
<s> but there was always a life cycle in their presentations . </s>
<s> so i went home and i took my wife home and told her , &quot; well , second time , when there is this technology to use your eyes to control things , then we should find a way that tempt can be able to make a laser a laser so that it could make a laser in jail that would be graffiti . &quot; </s>
<s> this is the beginning of the journey . </s>
<s> and about two years later , about a year later , after a lot of organization and a lot of to be broken , we &apos;ve achieved some things . </s>
<s> first of all , we &apos;ve forced open the doors the doors , and actually , for example , get a device to communicate with -- a stephen hawking-maschine . </s>
<s> that was incredible . </s>
<s> and it &apos;s really funny -- i call it yoda , because you talk to him , or you get an email , and he thinks , &quot; i &apos;m so derogatory , that guy is incredible . &quot; </s>
<s> also , we have seven programmers from all over the world -- literally from all the corners of the world -- to us . </s>
<s> my wife , my children and i are moved into garage , and those hackers and programmers and verschwörungstheoretiker and anarchisten , we took off our house . </s>
<s> many of our friends thought we were so stupid to do that and that we were zurückkämen and all the pictures on the walls would be graffitis given way . </s>
<s> but for over two weeks we have programmed , we went to the strandpromenade in venice , my children became involved , my dog , and we made this . </s>
<s> it &apos;s called eyewriter , and you can see the description . </s>
<s> this is a cheap sonnenbrille that we bought at the strandpromenade of venice , some kupferdraht and a few things out of the building and the elektronikhandel . </s>
<s> we took a ps3-kamera , they put it on a led-licht , and now we have a device that &apos;s free -- you can build it yourself -- you can build it yourself , we can put the code free for free , the software can download free . </s>
<s> so we have created a device that is entirely free by limitations . </s>
<s> you can &apos;t prevent insurance . </s>
<s> no hospital , too . </s>
<s> each paralyzed actually can communicate or draw with his eyes alone . </s>
<s> thank you . </s>
<s> thank you very much , that was incredible . </s>
<s> so , at the end of the two weeks , we went back to tempts room . </s>
<s> i love this picture , because it &apos;s somebody else &apos;s room , and that &apos;s his room . </s>
<s> now , there &apos;s all of these rummel . </s>
<s> and after a year of planning , two weeks programmierarbeit , nudelparties and durchgemachten nights , tony marked to market drew back after seven years . </s>
<s> and this is an amazing picture , because this is his life life life life , and it &apos;s looking at his life life . </s>
<s> we &apos;ve flooded his bed so that it can see out there . </s>
<s> we set up a spacecraft against a wall of parkplatztes in the hospital . </s>
<s> and he drew back for the first time , in the beisein of his family and friends -- and you can only imagine what a sense that was on the parking lot . </s>
<s> we also had to go through the parking lot , so we felt as part of the sprüher-szene . </s>
<s> by the end , he sent us an email with the following content : &quot; for the first time , i did something . </s>
<s> i feel like i got up to the water , and finally someone gripped down and brought into my head and i can breathe . &quot; </s>
<s> isn &apos;t overwhelming ? </s>
<s> this is something like our kampfschrei . </s>
<s> that &apos;s what keeps us on the floor , and let us continue further and further . </s>
<s> and we still need to improve a lot of this device . </s>
<s> it &apos;s an amazing device , but it &apos;s the same . </s>
<s> and somebody who has such artistic genius potential deserves so much more . </s>
<s> so we &apos;re going to figure out how to do better and faster and stronger . </s>
<s> since that time , we &apos;ve got all kinds of approval . </s>
<s> we &apos;ve won a few prizes . </s>
<s> think it &apos;s free , none of us deserves it . </s>
<s> it &apos;s all from our pockets . </s>
<s> so the awards were , &quot; oh , that &apos;s fantastic . &quot; </s>
<s> armstrong twitterte on us and then , in december , that was honored to us as one of the 50 best inventions in 2010 , which was really great . </s>
<s> this is what it &apos;s about -- and this includes the whole circle of the entire circle -- that it was this april where geffen moca in the inner city of los angeles are called an exhibition . </s>
<s> and that &apos;s where it &apos;s going to be pretty much the toughest vertreter of the world &apos;s worth -- banksy , shepard fairey , caws -- all these guys are going to be there . </s>
<s> tempt is going to be part of the show , which is pretty wild . </s>
<s> so , basically , this is where you see something that is impossible , then it can make it possible . </s>
<s> everything in this room was impossible -- this stage , this computer , this microphone , the eyewriter -- everything was impossible at any time . </s>
<s> make it possible -- you all of them here . </s>
<s> i &apos;m not a programmer , and i never had anything to do with anything , but i just kind of apprehended and surrounded me with amazing people so that we could put something on the legs . </s>
<s> and that question was not going to ask each of you and that every single day that you can do something that needs to be done well , that &apos;s what needs to be done . if not you , when ? and if not me , who ? </s>
<s> thank you . </s>
<s> so , i write for children , and i &apos;m probably probably amerikas kinderbuchautor . </s>
<s> and i always tell people that i &apos;m not going to come from a scientist . </s>
<s> you can get me as a farmer , or in leather , but nobody has ever chosen farmer . </s>
<s> today , i want to tell you about circles and offenbarungen . </s>
<s> well , an epiphany is usually something that you find , because you leave it somewhere . </s>
<s> you go around the block and take it as a revelation . </s>
<s> this is a picture of a circle . </s>
<s> one of my friends did it -- richard bollingbroke . </s>
<s> it &apos;s the kind of complicated thing that i want to tell you today . </s>
<s> my circle started at the time at high school in stow , ohio , where i was the klassenschwuchtel . </s>
<s> i was the one who beat every week in the jungentoilette green and blue , until a teacher saved my life . </s>
<s> she saved my life by using the toilet in the lehrerzimmer . </s>
<s> she did that . </s>
<s> she did it for three years . </s>
<s> and i had to go from the city . </s>
<s> i had a thumb , i had 85 dollars , and it turned me to san francisco in california -- i found a lover -- and i found it as important in the 1980s . </s>
<s> about three or four years ago , i received a phone call from this teacher , ms. to go for one's messages [Scot.] [to buy groceries] , who said , &quot; i &apos;ve got to see it . </s>
<s> i &apos;m sad that we never learned each other as adults . </s>
<s> can you come to ohio , please come to ohio , and please come together with the guy i know it &apos;s been found . </s>
<s> and i should mention that i &apos;ve got bauspeicheldrüsenkrebs , and i want you to be kidding . &quot; </s>
<s> well , the next day we were in cleveland . </s>
<s> we looked at her , we laughed , we cried , and we knew they needed to be in a hospice . </s>
<s> we found one for them , we brought them together , and we gave about them , and we gave about her family , because it was necessary . </s>
<s> it was something that we knew about . </s>
<s> and just as the woman who wanted to learn me as adults , they got me , they turned up into a box of asche and turned into my hands . </s>
<s> what happened was that the circle had closed , it was a circle -- and the epiphany of that i was talking about . </s>
<s> the revelation is , death is part of life . </s>
<s> she saved my life , and my partner and i saving her . </s>
<s> and you know , this part of life needs everything that needs the rest of life . </s>
<s> it needs to be truth and beauty , and i &apos;m so glad that it &apos;s been mentioned this many times . </s>
<s> it needs to be the same -- it needs to be , love and joy . and it &apos;s to us to give those things to . </s>
<s> thank you . </s>
<s> think of a great explosion , as it rises at 1,000 feet . </s>
<s> think of an airplane full of smoke . </s>
<s> think of a motor , the klack , klack , klack , klack , klack , klack , klack , klack , klack . </s>
<s> that sounds fear . </s>
<s> well , i had a unique place that day ; i was sitting on 1d . </s>
<s> i was the only one who could talk to the flugbegleitern . </s>
<s> so i looked at her the same , and they said , &quot; no problem , we &apos;ve got some birds . &quot; </s>
<s> the pilot had forked , and we weren &apos;t getting away so far . </s>
<s> you could see in manhattan . </s>
<s> two minutes later , three things happened . </s>
<s> the pilot placed the engine after the hudson river . </s>
<s> it &apos;s not normally route . </s>
<s> it schaltet the engine . </s>
<s> think of an silent car airplane . </s>
<s> and then he said three words -- the emotionslosesten words i &apos;ve ever heard . </s>
<s> he says , &quot; to get ready to the ground . &quot; </s>
<s> i didn &apos;t have to talk with the bordpersonal anymore anymore . </s>
<s> i could see it in their eyes , there was horror , life was ende . </s>
<s> so i want to share with you three things that i &apos;ve learned this day over this day . </s>
<s> i learned that in a moment , everything was different . </s>
<s> we have this lebensplan , we have these things that we want to make in life , and i was thinking about all the people i wanted to make a hand and didn &apos;t do it all the fences that i wanted to make all the experiences that i wanted to do . </s>
<s> as i thought about it later , a adage came to mind , which is , &quot; i collect bad wines . &quot; </s>
<s> because if the wine is over , and the person is there , and then i open it up . </s>
<s> i never want to move anything else . </s>
<s> and this urgency , this goal , changed my life . </s>
<s> the second thing i learned from that day -- and this is when we verfehlten the george washington bridge , so much about haaresbreite -- i thought , man , there &apos;s one thing i really bereue . </s>
<s> i had a good life . </s>
<s> in my own humanity and with my mistakes , i strebte to be better in everything i am in . </s>
<s> but in my humanity , i &apos;ve given my ego to my ego . </s>
<s> and i &apos;ve been bedauerte up the time that i wasted for matter of no importance things with people who mean something . </s>
<s> and i thought of the relationship with my wife , to friends , to people . </s>
<s> and after that , when i thought about it , i decided to ban negative energy from my life . </s>
<s> it &apos;s not perfect , but it &apos;s much better . </s>
<s> i &apos;ve had my wife altercated [archaic] for two years . </s>
<s> it feels great . </s>
<s> i &apos;m not trying to have the right more , i decide to be happy . </s>
<s> the third thing that i learned -- and during the inside of beginnnt , &quot; 15 , 14 , 13 , ... &quot; herunterzuzählen . </s>
<s> you see the water coming . </s>
<s> i said , &quot; please , flieg . &quot; </s>
<s> i don &apos;t want to beat this thing in 20 parts , as you know it from documentaries . </s>
<s> while we were born , i had this feeling , man , not being scary . </s>
<s> it &apos;s almost like we &apos;re preparing for our lives . </s>
<s> but it was very sad . </s>
<s> i didn &apos;t want to go ; i love my life . </s>
<s> and this is really in a thought , really in a thought , that i just wish with . </s>
<s> i just wish i could see my children growing up . </s>
<s> about a month after that , i visited my daughter &apos;s phone -- erstklässler , not much fun . </s>
<s> not yet . </s>
<s> and i feiere , i &apos;m crying like a little kid . </s>
<s> and in the world , everything got a sense of me . </s>
<s> and i realized at that time by putting the dots together , that it &apos;s only about being a fantastic father . </s>
<s> more than anything , everything else , my only aim in life is to be a good father . </s>
<s> i was told the wonder of dying of this day . </s>
<s> and i received another gift , which is to see in the future and come back and live . </s>
<s> my call to everybody who flies today is : imagine the same thing happens on your flight -- please not -- but ask it , and how would you change ? </s>
<s> what would you do that you to put off (until) because you think you &apos;d forever be there ? </s>
<s> how would you change your relationships and the negative energy in that ? </s>
<s> and more than anything , are you the best parents who you can only be ? </s>
<s> thank you . </s>
<s> the idea behind the stuxnet computer-wurm is pretty simple . </s>
<s> we don &apos;t want iran to build the bomb . </s>
<s> the most important to go for one's messages [Scot.] [to buy groceries] there for development of nuclear weapons is the uran-anreicherungs-einrichtung in upper-class circles in natanz . </s>
<s> the gray boxes you see over here , they &apos;re echtzeit-kontrollsysteme . </s>
<s> now , if we &apos;re able to get the systems to kompromittieren , which control drehzahlen and valves , then we can actually get a lot of problems with empathy . </s>
<s> these gray boxes don &apos;t run with windows-software ; they &apos;re based on a completely different technology . </s>
<s> but if we &apos;re able to make an effective windows-virus on a laptop that &apos;s used by a wartungsingenieur , it &apos;s used by a wartungsingenieur to to configurate this gray box . </s>
<s> and this is planning behind stuxnet . </s>
<s> so we start with a windows-dropper . </s>
<s> the nutzdaten are going to be transferred to the gray box , celebrate the welfare and the iranian kernenergie-programm belated -- mission accomplished . </s>
<s> this is a piece of money , right ? </s>
<s> let me tell you how we found this out . </s>
<s> when we started stuxnet our research , six months ago , it was completely unknown what was the point and purpose of this . </s>
<s> the only thing we knew is very , very complicated , which is the windows- part of the dropper- , the dropper- part , made by numerous zero- day- failures . </s>
<s> and it seemed kind of vorzuhaben , with these gray boxes , these echtzeit- kontrollsystemen . </s>
<s> it wrought-up discussion our attention , and we started a labor- project where we were infected our environments with stuxnet , and we studied this construct . </s>
<s> and then something funny happened . </s>
<s> stuxnet was the same like a laborratte that our cheese didn &apos;t like -- schnüffelte it , but didn &apos;t want to eat it . </s>
<s> that made no sense in my eyes . </s>
<s> and after we had done with different kinds of cheese , i realized that this was a surgical strike attack . </s>
<s> it was entirely addressed (to) . </s>
<s> the dropper streift active on the gray box , when they discovered a special configuration , even when the one program that has been to infect it is going to work on this destination . </s>
<s> and if you don &apos;t , you don &apos;t do anything . </s>
<s> so , this is what weckte was looking , and we started working with it almost about the clock , because i thought , well , we don &apos;t know what the goal is . </s>
<s> it could be , say , for example , an us- american power station , or an chemieanlage in germany . </s>
<s> so we should soon figure out what the goal is . </s>
<s> so extrahierten and dekompilierten the angriffs- code , and found out that , in two digital , aufstrukturiert , it &apos;s a smaller one and a bigger one . </s>
<s> and also , we noticed that they were very professional , by the people who were clearly available with each other . </s>
<s> they knew all kinds of bits and bytes that they had to attack . </s>
<s> they probably knew that they even knew the schuhgröße of maschinenbedieners . </s>
<s> so they knew everything . </s>
<s> and if you &apos;ve noticed that the dropper is complex and high-tech , let me tell you , the nutzdaten is a science for itself . </s>
<s> it &apos;s much bigger than anything we &apos;ve ever seen . </s>
<s> this is a clip from this angriffs- code . </s>
<s> we &apos;re talking about -- about 15,000 lines code . </s>
<s> looks pretty much like old-fashioned assemblersprache . </s>
<s> and i want to tell you how we were able to be smart from this code . </s>
<s> so what we thought about as the very first was systemfunktions- aufrufe , because we know what it does . </s>
<s> and then we were looking for timern and datenstrukturen and datenstrukturen and tried to bring that to the real world -- potential potential in the real world . </s>
<s> so we needed theories of these goals that we could give or disprove . </s>
<s> in order to make these theories , let &apos;s argue that it &apos;s definitely about intense episodic dysphoria sabotage , it has to act about a high-grade paper goal , and very likely , it &apos;s in iran because most of the infections have been reported . </s>
<s> well , there aren &apos;t several thousand goals in this area . </s>
<s> basically , it &apos;s turning out onto the buschehr fluid and the urananreicherungsanlage in natanz . </s>
<s> so i said to my assistant , &quot; let me give you a list of all of the experts of zentrifugen and plant power . &quot; </s>
<s> and i called them , and i watched her knowledge to compare your expertise with what we found in the code and the data . </s>
<s> and that worked very well . </s>
<s> so , it was possible to get us to connect the little digital sprengkopf with the rotorsteuerung . </s>
<s> and the rotor is the moving part of the computational part , this black object that you see . </s>
<s> and if you &apos;re manipulating the speed of this rotors , then you can actually crack the rotor , and even to get the coordination down . </s>
<s> what we also found out is that the goal of the attack was to actually get it slowly and to make it incredibly exciting -- apparently in the attempt to try to to become desperate wartungsingenieure , so she would not be able to get out of it . </s>
<s> the great digital sprengkopf -- we received a glimpse by looking at very much the same data and datenstrukturen . </s>
<s> so for example , the number of 164 is going to go around this code ; you can &apos;t miss it . </s>
<s> i began to durchzuarbeiten in the scientific literature , about how these zentrifugen are made in natanz , and found that they were patterned in something called kaskaden , and each kaskade contains 164 zentrifugen . </s>
<s> so that made sense , it adapted . </s>
<s> and it got better than that . </s>
<s> these zentrifugen in iran are divided in 15 circles . </s>
<s> and guess what we found in the angriffscode ? </s>
<s> almost identical structure . </s>
<s> so again , that &apos;s really good stuff . </s>
<s> and this gave us great confidence for what we studied here . </s>
<s> now , don &apos;t get me wrong , that &apos;s not just true . </s>
<s> these results came hard through several weeks hard work . </s>
<s> and a lot of times , we ran into a dead death , and we needed to collect ourselves . </s>
<s> but what we found was that both of the digital sprengköpfe in reality was in one way and the same objective , but from different directions . </s>
<s> and the small sprengkopf takes over a kaskade , and they keyed up the execution and slowed it down , and the great one is represented with six kaskaden in interactions and manipulating valves . </s>
<s> so , in great and large , we &apos;re very hopeful that we actually have known what the goal is . </s>
<s> it &apos;s natanz , and it &apos;s just natanz . </s>
<s> so we don &apos;t worry about the fact that other goals might be made by stuxnet . </s>
<s> there &apos;s something really cool stuff that we &apos;ve discovered , which we discovered -- made my socks come out of my socks . </s>
<s> the gray box down there is the gray box , and you see the zentrifugen . </s>
<s> now , what this thing is doing is that it &apos;s going to be the eingehenden values of sensors -- so for example , of drucksensoren and vibrationssensoren -- and it provides legitimen code that are even at the attack with any false data . </s>
<s> and actually , this false mechanical data is made by stuxnet before . </s>
<s> so it &apos;s just like in hollywoodfilmen , where , during the verfolgungsjagd , the überwachungskamera is fed by aufgenommenem videoaufnahmen . </s>
<s> that &apos;s cool , right ? </s>
<s> the idea here is obviously not just to cheat the maschinenbediener in control control . </s>
<s> in fact , it &apos;s much more dangerous and more violent . </s>
<s> the idea is to cheat a digital sicherheitssystem . </s>
<s> we need digital sicherheitssysteme where a human maschinenbediener cannot respond fast enough . </s>
<s> so in a power station , for example , if the great dampfturbine becomes fast , you &apos;ve got to open entlastungsventile in milliseconds . </s>
<s> of course , this cannot be done by a human maschinenführer . </s>
<s> so , at this point we need digital sicherheitssysteme . </s>
<s> and if they &apos;re in risk , really bad things can happen . </s>
<s> it can explode . </s>
<s> and neither the maschinenführer , nor the sicherheitssystem , will notice . </s>
<s> this is scary . </s>
<s> but it &apos;s getting worse . </s>
<s> and what i &apos;m saying about this is very important . </s>
<s> think about it . this assault is generic . </s>
<s> he has nothing to do specifically with zentrifugen , with urananreicherung . </s>
<s> so , for example , it would work so well -- in a power station or a automobilfabrik . </s>
<s> it &apos;s generic . </s>
<s> and you don &apos;t have to -- you don &apos;t have to go -- than the attacker -- you don &apos;t have to go through a usb- stick , as we &apos;ve seen at stuxnet . </s>
<s> you could also use ordinary wurm- technology . </s>
<s> you just have to change it as much as possible . </s>
<s> and eventually , if you do that , eventually you end up with a cyber- massenvernichtungswaffe . </s>
<s> that &apos;s the consequence we need to ask . </s>
<s> so unfortunately , the greatest number of goals is not in the central east . </s>
<s> they are in the united states , europe and japan . </s>
<s> so all of these green areas , these are the zielreichsten environments . </s>
<s> we need to make the consequences , and we &apos;re getting better at it . </s>
<s> thank you . </s>
<s> i have a question . </s>
<s> ralph , it &apos;s been reported very much to say that the mossad is the hauptorganisation behind . </s>
<s> is it your mind ? </s>
<s> okay , you really want to know this ? </s>
<s> yeah . okay . </s>
<s> i think that it &apos;s involved , but the driving force is not israel . </s>
<s> so the driving power behind it is the cyber- superpower . </s>
<s> there &apos;s only one , and that &apos;s the united states -- fortunately , happiness . </s>
<s> because otherwise , our problem would be even bigger . </s>
<s> thank you for having a heidenangst eingejagt . thank you ralph . </s>
<s> i spent the last few years trying to put me in situations , which usually are very difficult , and in fact , they &apos;re dangerous . </s>
<s> i went to jail -- hard . </s>
<s> i worked in a kohlebergwerk -- dangerous . </s>
<s> i was shot in kriegsgebieten -- difficult and dangerous . </s>
<s> and i spent 30 days doing nothing but to eat nothing like this -- at the beginning , a little bit in the middle , very dangerous at the end . </s>
<s> in fact , i &apos;ve been exposed to most of my career &apos;s most advanced situations , and all of this just for the attempt to study social arguments that they are compelling and interesting , and hopefully to understand a kind of understanding what are going on for the audience and make it available . </s>
<s> so when i knew that i was going to get here to look at the world of branding and sponsoring sponsoring , i knew i was going to do something slightly different . </s>
<s> some of you may have heard that i took an ad on ebay a couple of weeks ago . </s>
<s> i sent a bunch of facebook-nachrichten , some twitter-nachrichten , and i gave people the ability to to acquire the namensrechte of my tedtalk in 2011 . </s>
<s> so , really , some happy people and companies , for-profit and non-profit , given the unique opportunity -- because i &apos;m sure chris anderson &apos;s going to buy it -- that you &apos;re not going to take a title -- a story has a lot of content , and there &apos;s not a lot of evidence about what it &apos;s going to be like . </s>
<s> so what you &apos;ve been given is this : your name here : my tedtalk , that you don &apos;t know what the subject is going to be , and that will be able to fly on your ears for your ears , especially when i give your beteiligung to you silly . </s>
<s> but more than that , it &apos;s a very good fossil opportunity . </s>
<s> you know , how many people are looking at these tedtalks ? </s>
<s> a lot of things . </s>
<s> this is only the arbeitstitel . </s>
<s> so despite that warning , i knew somebody would buy the namensrechte . </s>
<s> if you had asked me this one year ago , i wouldn &apos;t have been able to say that with certainty . </s>
<s> but in the new project that i &apos;m working on , my new film , we study the world of marketing . </s>
<s> so , like i said , i &apos;ve been going on in some really horrible situations over the course of the years , but nothing could be prepared me , nothing really allowed me to to arm to something that &apos;s so difficult and as dangerous as these guys go into a room . </s>
<s> you know , i had the idea for a movie . </s>
<s> what i want to do is take a movie around product placement , marketing and advertising , all the film is funded by product placement , marketing and advertising . </s>
<s> and the movie is called &quot; the greatest movie ever [of all time] [postpos.] ever [of all time] [postpos.] . &quot; </s>
<s> so what happens in &quot; the greatest greatest movie ever [of all time] [postpos.] , &quot; is that everything , from the top up to the end , has been entirely equipped with by marken -- the titelsponsor that you &apos;re going to see in the movie , that &apos;s the brand x. </s>
<s> so this brand , the qualcomm stadion , the staples center . </s>
<s> these people will be connected to that movie in 1900 -- forever . </s>
<s> and so the film &apos;s going to study this whole idea -- that &apos;s what ? forever , forever ? </s>
<s> i am a redundant array of inexpensive disks <RAID> [dated] person . </s>
<s> that was more of stopping . </s>
<s> it was &quot; forever , forever . &quot; </s>
<s> but what we &apos;re not only going to do is we &apos;re going to have the brand of x as titelsponsor , but we &apos;re going to make sure we &apos;re going to be selling any possible category in the movie . </s>
<s> so we might sell a shoe , and it &apos;s going to be the greatest shoe you &apos;ve ever been . </s>
<s> the biggest car that they have ever been charged from &quot; the greatest movie ever [of all time] [postpos.] ever [of all time] [postpos.] sold &quot; the greatest drink you &apos;ve ever had , &quot; the greatest movie movie ever [of all time] [postpos.] sold . &quot; </s>
<s> so the idea is , besides showing it to show you that brands are a part of life , actually , to get you to pay the movie ? </s>
<s> and we really show the whole process of how it works . </s>
<s> the goal of the whole film is transparency . </s>
<s> you &apos;ll see the whole thing in the movie of statten . </s>
<s> so this is the whole concept , the whole film , from the beginning to the end . </s>
<s> and i would be happy if ceg would help to make this happen . </s>
<s> you know , it &apos;s funny , because when i heard it first , it &apos;s the ultimate respect for the audience . </s>
<s> but i don &apos;t know how many people are going to be . </s>
<s> you have a perspective -- i don &apos;t want to use &quot; vantage , &quot; because that &apos;s got a negative konnotation -- but you know how this is going to happen ? </s>
<s> how much money is needed to notice that ? </s>
<s> 1.5 million . </s>
<s> i think it &apos;s hard to get you to meet them , but i think it &apos;s not worth any case to address some really known brands . </s>
<s> who knows , when the movie comes out , maybe we look like a horde . </s>
<s> what do you think the answer is ? </s>
<s> the answer is probably not going to be &quot; no &quot; . </s>
<s> but is it a difficult thing for the film or a difficult thing for me ? </s>
<s> jk : both . </s>
<s> so ... meaning not so optimistic . </s>
<s> so , sir , can you help me ? i need help . </s>
<s> i can help . </s>
<s> okay . </s>
<s> fantastic . </s>
<s> we need to think about what brands are . </s>
<s> yeah . </s>
<s> if you look at the people that you have to do with ... </s>
<s> there are some places that we can turn on . </s>
<s> put the camera out . </s>
<s> i thought , &quot; well , put the camera out , &quot; would mean that we wanted to do a hintergrundgespräch . </s>
<s> it turned out that it meant in fact , &quot; we don &apos;t want to do with your movie anything . &quot; </s>
<s> and just so disappeared all these companies , one out of one . </s>
<s> no one wanted to do something with the movie . </s>
<s> i was amazed . </s>
<s> they didn &apos;t want to do anything with the project . </s>
<s> and i was confused , because i thought , the whole concept , the idea of advertising , is to present your product as many people as possible as possible as possible . </s>
<s> especially in the world today , in this interface of new and old media and the zerstückelten media landscape -- it &apos;s not the idea of being in this new experiment , the bulk of this news . </s>
<s> no , that was what i thought . </s>
<s> but look , the problem was my idea of a fatalen error , and that was the following . </s>
<s> actually no , that was not the mistakes at all . </s>
<s> that would not have been a problem at all . </s>
<s> that would have been okay . </s>
<s> but what this picture is , is a problem . </s>
<s> you see , when you &apos;re looking at transparency at google-suche , this is one of the first images that comes out . </s>
<s> i really like your kind , sergey brin . now . </s>
<s> this was the problem : transparency -- free to deception and tücke , just to detect and to see through ; immediately comprehensible , mixing by sichtbarkeit and the access to information , especially what geschäftspraktiken are -- the last line is certainly the biggest problem . </s>
<s> you know , we &apos;re listening to a whole lot of transparency . </s>
<s> our politicians tell it , our president says , even our ceos say it . </s>
<s> but when it comes down , it &apos;s supposed to be implemented . </s>
<s> but why ? well transparency is fear -- like this strange bear , which is still brüllt . </s>
<s> she &apos;s unpredictable -- like this strange landstraße . </s>
<s> and it &apos;s also very risky . </s>
<s> what else do we do ? </s>
<s> a whole bowl of cool food . </s>
<s> that &apos;s very risky . </s>
<s> so when i started talking to companies and tell them that we wanted to tell them that story , they said , &quot; no , we want you to tell a story . </s>
<s> we want you to tell a story , but we want you to tell our story . &quot; </s>
<s> you see , when i was a kid and my dad caught me up to lie -- and there he is sitting and looking at me with this view -- he would say , &quot; my son , there &apos;s three versions in each story . </s>
<s> there &apos;s your version , there &apos;s my version , and there &apos;s the real version . &quot; </s>
<s> so , you see , with this movie we wanted to tell the true version . </s>
<s> but there &apos;s only one company , an agency ready to help us -- and only because i knew john bond and richard kirshenbaum since years -- i found that i needed to do it alone , i had to go around the mittelsmann and go directly with my team to the companies . </s>
<s> so what they started to do was starting to understand -- or what i started to understand -- was that , if you start talking to these companies , the idea of how your brand is going to understand a broad problem . </s>
<s> i have friends , the great , gigantic hollywood-filme , and i have friends , the little independent-filme i do . </s>
<s> and my friends , the great , gigantic hollywood-filme , say that the reason their films are so successful on the markenpartnern is the markenpartnern that they have . </s>
<s> and then my friends , the little independent-filme are going , &quot; well , how do we compete with these big , gigantic hollywood-filmen ? &quot; </s>
<s> and the movie is called &quot; the greatest movie ever [of all time] [postpos.] sold . &quot; </s>
<s> so how exactly are we going to see ban ban in the movie ? </s>
<s> whenever i go to the path , and whenever i open the medizinschrank , you &apos;ll see ban deodorant . </s>
<s> and every time i interviewe somebody , i can say , &quot; are you fresh enough for this interview ? </s>
<s> are they ? they look a little nervous . </s>
<s> let me help you to calm . </s>
<s> so you might be thinking of it a little bit of this . &quot; </s>
<s> and then we provide one of these great düfte . </s>
<s> either &quot; floral fusion &quot; or a &quot; paradise winds . &quot; </s>
<s> we will be equipped for men as well -- to firm up [egg, dough, etc.] , roll-on , or one stick , whatever . </s>
<s> this is the kurzfassung kurzfassung . </s>
<s> now , i can answer all of your questions and give them a ausfühliche version . </s>
<s> we &apos;re a smaller token . </s>
<s> as you &apos;ve talked about the smaller movies , we are as a celebration . </s>
<s> so we don &apos;t have a budget like other brands . </s>
<s> so to make things like this -- you know , reminds people of ban -- that &apos;s kind of why we &apos;re interested . </s>
<s> which words would you describe to ban ban ? </s>
<s> ban is bare . </s>
<s> that &apos;s a great question . </s>
<s> superior stocks technology . </s>
<s> technology is not the way someone should describe something that does somebody do that achseln . </s>
<s> we &apos;re talking about adventurous [daring] , fresh . </s>
<s> and i think , &quot; fresh &quot; is a great word that this category really makes up to something positive , unlike odor and moisture . &quot; </s>
<s> it keeps you fresh . </s>
<s> how can we hold it longer -- better fresh fresh , more fresh fresh , three air . </s>
<s> things like that have a positivere effect . </s>
<s> and this is a millionen-konzern . </s>
<s> what about me ? what about the druchschittstypen ? </s>
<s> i have to talk to the guy on the street , which are like me , otto-normal-verbraucher . </s>
<s> you want to tell me something about my brand . </s>
<s> how would you describe your brand ? </s>
<s> hmmm , my brand ? </s>
<s> i don &apos;t know . </s>
<s> i really like nice clothing . </s>
<s> 80er revival , besides the waschtag . </s>
<s> all right , what &apos;s the brand gerry ? </s>
<s> unique . </s>
<s> i think the genre , the style i have , is probably &quot; dark glamour . &quot; </s>
<s> i like lots of black colors , lots of grautöne and so forth . </s>
<s> but i usually have a accessoire , like sonnenbrillen , or a jewelry and such a thing . </s>
<s> when dan would be a brand , he would probably cabrio a classic limb . </s>
<s> man 2 : the brand i am , i would say , koosh job [Am.] [sl.] fly . </s>
<s> woman 2 : partly lux , partly of multitasking , partly brooklyn-mädchen -- i don &apos;t know . </s>
<s> man 3 : i &apos;m the schmusetyp . </s>
<s> i train schmusetiere across the country around the world . </s>
<s> so i think that &apos;s my brand . </s>
<s> this is my brand in my small , verzerrten industry . </s>
<s> man 4 : my brand is fedex , because i was ausliefere . </s>
<s> man 5 : brand gescheiteter alkoholsüchtiger schreiberling . </s>
<s> does that matter ? </s>
<s> lawyer : i am a anwaltsmarke . </s>
<s> i &apos;m tom . </s>
<s> well , we can &apos;t be all of the tom-marke , but i often look at the interface of dark glamour and slouch hat fly . </s>
<s> and what she noticed was that i needed an expert . </s>
<s> i needed somebody who could go into my head , somebody that really help me understand what &apos;s called the &quot; markenpersönlichkeit . &quot; </s>
<s> and so i found a company called olson zaltman in pittsburg . </s>
<s> they have helped companies like nestle , febreze , hallmark , trying to discover this markenpersönlichkeit . </s>
<s> if they could do it for it , they could help me . </s>
<s> you &apos;ve brought your pictures , right ? </s>
<s> this is what i got . the first picture is a picture of my family . </s>
<s> tell me a little bit about how that &apos;s connected to your thoughts and emotions about them . </s>
<s> these are the people who shape my worldview . </s>
<s> tell me about this world . </s>
<s> md : this world is the world where you live ? i think the world &apos;s own world is the world where you live -- like humans , your friends , your family , the way you live your life , the work and so on . </s>
<s> all of these things are coming and start from a place , and for me and start with my family in west virginia . </s>
<s> what &apos;s the next thing you want to talk about . </s>
<s> the next . this was the most beautiful day of my life . </s>
<s> what is it about the mind and emotions about you ? </s>
<s> it &apos;s the way i want to be . </s>
<s> i like things that are different . </s>
<s> i like things that are weird . i like strange things . </s>
<s> tell me about the &quot; why &quot; -phase -- what would you do ? </s>
<s> what &apos;s the machete ? what are the puppenstadium ? </s>
<s> why is it important , neuzustarten ? what does the red matter ? </s>
<s> tell me a little bit about that part . </s>
<s> a little bit more about you , that &apos;s not you . </s>
<s> what else do they get through ? </s>
<s> -- this doesn &apos;t have to be a fear . in what kind of rollercoaster are you ? </s>
<s> eeeeee ! no , thank you . </s>
<s> thank you very much . </s>
<s> yeah . well , good . </s>
<s> yeah , i don &apos;t know what &apos;s going on . </s>
<s> and there &apos;s quite a lot of crazy things happening . </s>
<s> the first thing that i saw was this idea that their markenpersönlichekti had two separate separate , but to defy (any) explanation pages -- the morgan spurlock-marke is a achtsame / playful kittens brand . </s>
<s> it &apos;s very good . </s>
<s> and i think there &apos;s almost a contradiction with this . </s>
<s> and i think some companies will only focus on an strength instead of both of them . </s>
<s> and many companies tend to avoid -- and that &apos;s the human nature -- to avoid things they &apos;re not sure about , they &apos;re afraid , they &apos;re afraid of being afraid , they &apos;re afraid of these things , and they turn them into something positive , and that &apos;s a clever workman schachzug . </s>
<s> what other brands are doing ? </s>
<s> the first one is a classic , apple . </s>
<s> and you can also see it here , target target , wii , mini , mini coopers and jetblue . </s>
<s> well , there are playful kittens brands and achtsame brands , these things that come and go , but a playful kittens , achtsame brand is a pretty strong thing . </s>
<s> a achtsame , playful kittens brand . how is your brand ? </s>
<s> if someone would ask you to describe your markenidentität , your markenpersönlichkeit , what would you do ? </s>
<s> you do it with an up-attribut ? are you something that brings your blood up in wallungen ? </s>
<s> or are they more of a down-attribut ? </s>
<s> are you something that &apos;s kind of quiet , reserved portion , conservative ? </s>
<s> up-attribute are things that are beneficial , much like the fresh prince , appropriate [up to date] , adventuresome , edgy , edgy and charming like erol flynn , agile and agile , profanatory , authoritative , magical , magic , like gandalf . </s>
<s> or are they more like a down-attribut ? </s>
<s> are you cautious and (highly) fashionable like 007 ? </s>
<s> are they established , traditionally , caring [nursing, fostering] , guarding , caring like oprah ? </s>
<s> are they reliable , stable , familial , sure , rescued , Saint <St.> , attentive , like the dalai lama or yoda ? </s>
<s> in the course of the film , we had over 500 companies that were rising and down-firmen , and the &quot; no , &quot; because they wanted to be part of the project . </s>
<s> they didn &apos;t want to do anything with this movie because they didn &apos;t have any control , no control over the finished product . </s>
<s> but it turns out that there were 17 markenpartner that were willing to give up to this control that wanted to do business with someone who wanted to say to someone and make things like me , and then finally , to tell stories that we don &apos;t normally couldn &apos;t tell -- stories that would never have been able to support a werber . </s>
<s> they befähigten us to tell the story of neuromarketing , just as we told the story in this film , that you are now using mris of mris to anzupeilen the lustzentren of the brain in the same way to make more ads and films . </s>
<s> we went to sao paulo , where außenwerbung was banned . </s>
<s> in the entire city for five years , no posters , no posters , no flyer , nothing . </s>
<s> and we went to school school , where they were asking their way to conduct their way in verarmte schools , across america . </s>
<s> and the incredible thing for me is that the projects that i &apos;ve been given most of the feedback , or where i had the worst success , are that , where i interacted with things . </s>
<s> and this is what these brands have done . </s>
<s> because they umgingen the mittelsmann , they umgingen the drug , and they said that maybe the agencies don &apos;t really feel their interest . </s>
<s> i &apos;m going to negotiate with the artist directly . </s>
<s> i &apos;m going to work with it and create something completely different , something that people want to think about is that our world challenges . </s>
<s> and what was it for you ? what successful ? </s>
<s> well , since the movie had the sundance film festival festival , we can look at it . </s>
<s> in january , the balls was in january , and since then -- and that &apos;s not the whole thing -- there were 900 million aufrufe of this movie . </s>
<s> this actually includes one season from two / two weeks . </s>
<s> this is just online -- no press , no television . </s>
<s> it didn &apos;t even go ahead . </s>
<s> it &apos;s not even there . it &apos;s not even streaming . </s>
<s> it &apos;s not in other countries . </s>
<s> well , after all , the film has a very large momentum . </s>
<s> and that &apos;s not bad for a project that almost every werbeagentur that we talked about , their clients didn &apos;t have recommended . </s>
<s> something that i &apos;m sure of sure is that if you &apos;re sending your chance to arrest risks that are in those risks . </s>
<s> i think if you prevent people from it , you get them to failure . </s>
<s> i believe that if you train your employees to avoid risk , you &apos;re going to be able to avoid the whole company to get a profit . </s>
<s> i have the feeling that we need to encourage people to take risks . </s>
<s> we have to encourage people to have no fear of opportunities that might to fill with terror [frighten] you . </s>
<s> finally , at the time , we should be welcome to fear . </s>
<s> we should put the bear in the cage . </s>
<s> you name the fear . to be called the risk . </s>
<s> each one has a great taste , so we welcome the risk . </s>
<s> and finally , we should welcome transparency . </s>
<s> today , more than ever before , it gives us a little bit of honesty . </s>
<s> and this , with honesty and transparency , my entire talk , &quot; name her transparency , was going to meet them from my good friends of emc , the Seven Wonders of the (Ancient) World 7100 for the namensrechte . </s>
<s> big data is transforming for organizations around the world . </s>

<s> thank you very much . </s>
<s> so morgan , in the name of transparency , which is what happened right now with $ 7100 ? </s>
<s> that &apos;s a great question . </s>
<s> i have a check in my pocket , issued to the consignor the oberorganisation , the sapling-stiftung , the sapling-stiftung , the sapling-stiftung -- a check at the altitude of $ 7100 to fund my ted-auftritt in the next year . </s>
<s> my name is amit . </s>
<s> 18 months ago , i did something else at google , and i regte to make something with museums and art , and my chefin , which is also today , gave me green light . </s>
<s> and it took 18 months . </s>
<s> a lot of comic character negotiations and stories , i can tell you , with 17 very interesting museums from nine countries . </s>
<s> but i &apos;m going to focus on the demo . </s>
<s> so there &apos;s a lot of stories about why we did this . </s>
<s> i think my personal perspective is very simple with this slide and her access . </s>
<s> i grew up in india . </s>
<s> i &apos;ve been given a great education -- i don &apos;t pay me -- but i had a lot of museums and this work . </s>
<s> when i went to go to visit those museums , i started learning a lot . </s>
<s> and while i was doing google , i tried to do this kind of sehnsucht -- to make art with technology . </s>
<s> we then put a team , a great team , and we began with it . </s>
<s> i &apos;m probably going to start with the demonstration , and tell you some interesting things that happened since the beginning . </s>
<s> so you go too much . </s>
<s> you can look around these museums in all these museums . </s>
<s> there &apos;s the uffizi , the moma , the hermitage , the rijks , the van gogh . </s>
<s> i even come into one of my favorite , the metropolitan museum of art in new york . </s>
<s> you come in two ways -- very simple . </s>
<s> click , and wumms , you &apos;re in this museum . </s>
<s> it doesn &apos;t matter where you are -- bombay , mexico , it doesn &apos;t make any difference . </s>
<s> you go around and amused . </s>
<s> you want to orient in the museum ? </s>
<s> open up the map , jump it up with a click . </s>
<s> in the field , they want to be , they want to go to the end of the cluster . </s>
<s> just further . much fun . </s>
<s> to browse them . </s>
<s> thank you , but the best one comes up . </s>
<s> so , i am in front of a lieblingsbilder , erntearbeiter from pieter breugel in the met . </s>
<s> i see this pluszeichen . </s>
<s> if the museum gave us the picture , they click on it . </s>
<s> so this is one of the images . </s>
<s> these are all metadata . </s>
<s> those of you who are really interested in art can click here -- but i &apos;ll click on it now . </s>
<s> this is one of the images we play with what we call the so-called gigapixel-technologie . </s>
<s> this picture , for example , has about 10 billion bildpunkte , i think . </s>
<s> and a lot of people ask me , &quot; what do you do for 10 billion ? &quot; </s>
<s> this is what i &apos;m going to show you now . </s>
<s> you can go into it very easily and to zoom out . </s>
<s> you &apos;ll notice something funny here . </s>
<s> i love this guy ; his expression is priceless . </s>
<s> but then you really want to go deep . </s>
<s> and so i started playing around , and i realized there was something happening there . </s>
<s> and i thought , &quot; wait a minute , that sounds interesting . &quot; </s>
<s> i went close , and i realized that these children were actually schlugen . </s>
<s> i worked a little bit , talking to some known at the met , and actually found it to be a game called squail , where a goose is hit at the fastnachtsdienstag with a stick . </s>
<s> apparently it was very popular . </s>
<s> i don &apos;t know why they did , but i learned something about it . </s>
<s> to really go close to that , you can go to fast . </s>
<s> just to give you the grasp , i &apos;ll go out and see what you get . </s>
<s> this is where we were , and this is the picture . </s>
<s> the best one , though , is in a second . </s>
<s> let &apos;s go quickly to moma , back again in new york . </s>
<s> one more lieblingsbild of mine , sternennacht . </s>
<s> for the previous example , it was about finding detail . </s>
<s> but what if you want to see the pinselstriche ? </s>
<s> and what first happens when you want to see van gogh did this masterpiece ? </s>
<s> you put it in . you can go in . </s>
<s> i &apos;m going to zoom into one of my lieblingsteile this slide until i &apos;m really isolated . </s>
<s> this is sternennacht , probably never seen before . </s>
<s> now i &apos;m going to show you my favorite function . </s>
<s> there &apos;s many , but i &apos;m missing time . </s>
<s> this is the really cool part , he &apos;s called collections . </s>
<s> any of you , everybody , everybody -- equal or five , if you have a great house -- doesn &apos;t matter . </s>
<s> they can go through and build their own museum online , and they can build their own collection . </s>
<s> very simple , they go in -- and i created this , it means the power of zoom -- they can umherzoomen . </s>
<s> this is the gesandten , in upper-class circles . </s>
<s> you can put all of these with your friends , send your friends , and you start a conversation about what you feel when you look at these masterpieces . </s>
<s> i think , finally , for me , the main thing for me is that all of the wonderful things don &apos;t come from google . </s>
<s> they don &apos;t even think of it from museums . </s>
<s> that &apos;s not what i should say . </s>
<s> they come from the artists . </s>
<s> and that was kind of a experience for me . </s>
<s> i mean , i hope that we &apos;re going to be our equitable with this digital medium of art , and represent them properly online . </s>
<s> it &apos;s the biggest question that comes up with me recently , &quot; did you do that to replicate the experience of a museumsbesuchs ? &quot; </s>
<s> the answer to this is no . </s>
<s> it &apos;s going to give up the experience . </s>
<s> that &apos;s what it &apos;s about . thank you . </s>
<s> thank you . </s>
<s> this is an illustration of your brain . your brain can be divided in two to halve . </s>
<s> this is the left half , which is the logical side and then the right half , which is the ultimate one . </s>
<s> if we would have a scale to measure the aptitute of the hemisphere , we could to act a character your brain . </s>
<s> for example , this one would be completely logical . </s>
<s> this would be somebody who is completely intuitive . </s>
<s> now , where would you to position your brain at this scale ? </s>
<s> some of us might have chosen for one of these extremes , but i think that , for most people in the audience , their brain looks around this -- with a high aptitute , which is at the same time . </s>
<s> it &apos;s not like they &apos;re classy  [coll.] or something like that . </s>
<s> they can be logical and intuitive . </s>
<s> and this is what i look at as one of those individuals , together with most other experimental quantenphysikern that need a good proportion of logic to add the complex ideas together . </s>
<s> but at the same time , we need a good amount of intuition to do the experiments . </s>
<s> how do we develop this intuition ? well , we love to play it with things . </s>
<s> so we go out and we play with it and then they respond to it , and then we start developing our intuition . </s>
<s> they basically do the same thing . </s>
<s> so one of the intuitions you &apos;ve developed over the years is that one thing can be at the same time only in one place . </s>
<s> i mean , it might sound strange sounds to think that a thing at the same time in two different places , but they were not born with this idea , they developed it . </s>
<s> i remember seeing a child playing on a bodenschwelle . </s>
<s> he was still a kleinkind and not very good at it , and it fell constantly . </s>
<s> but i bet that there &apos;s going to be a very valuable lesson that we &apos;ve been taught with the bodenschwelle , which is the big stuff you can &apos;t just get over , and that they remain . </s>
<s> and this is a great conceptual data model model in the world , so long as they &apos;re teilchenphysiker . </s>
<s> it would be a terrible model for a teilchenphysiker , because they don &apos;t play with bodenschwellen , but with these little strange particles . </s>
<s> and if you &apos;re playing with your particles , you &apos;ll find all kinds of weird things -- how you fly directly through walls , or that you can be in two different places at the same time . </s>
<s> and so they wrote all these observations , and they called the theory of quantum mechanics . </s>
<s> this was the state of physics a few years ago ; they needed quantum mechanics to describe the small , tiny particles . </s>
<s> but you didn &apos;t need it to describe the great everyday objects around us . </s>
<s> this hasn &apos;t liked my intuition and it may only be because i don &apos;t play with particles . </s>
<s> well , i sometimes play with you , but not very often . </s>
<s> and i haven &apos;t seen it yet . </s>
<s> i mean , nobody ever saw particles . </s>
<s> but my logical side of it doesn &apos;t like it either . </s>
<s> because if all kinds of things are of particles and all these particles follow the rules of quantum mechanics , shouldn &apos;t it be easy to the rules of quantum mechanics ? </s>
<s> i don &apos;t see why it &apos;s not supposed to be that way . </s>
<s> so i would look at so much with the whole thing , if we could show that alltagsgegenstände follow the rules of quantum mechanics . </s>
<s> so a few years ago , i was doing that in the same way . </s>
<s> i created one . </s>
<s> this is the first object you can see that was in the quantenmechanischen superposition . </s>
<s> so what we &apos;re looking at here is a tiny computer chip . </s>
<s> and you can see this green dot there in the center . </s>
<s> this is the piece of metal that i &apos;m going to talk about . </s>
<s> this is a picture of the object . </s>
<s> this is what i &apos;m vergrößere . we look at the center right here . </s>
<s> and this is a really very large close-up of this little piece of metal . </s>
<s> so what we &apos;re looking at is a small piece of metal it &apos;s shaped like a doctor and it &apos;s over the edge . </s>
<s> so i made this thing in similar ways that you make a computer chip . </s>
<s> i went to a clean room with new siliziumscheiben , and rackerte for 100 hours to all of the major devices . </s>
<s> for the last time , i had to build my own machine -- to get this kind of swimming pool of crossing and get the thing . </s>
<s> this thing has the ability to be in the quantenmechanischen superposition , but it takes a little bit of help to do it . </s>
<s> look , let me give you an analogy . </s>
<s> you know how awkward it &apos;s going to be in a full limb ? </s>
<s> i mean , if i &apos;m in the elevator alone , i &apos;m going to do all kinds of weird things , and then i &apos;m going to do all kinds of weird things , and i &apos;m going to stop doing all these things , because i don &apos;t want to help them with it , or frankly , frankly , she verschrecke . </s>
<s> so quantum mechanics says that immovables objects feel the same way . </s>
<s> it &apos;s not just people who are mitfahrer objects are not only people , but the light that appears to them and the wind that seems to fegt and the hitze of space . </s>
<s> and so we knew that if we wanted to see that this piece of metal acts , we needed to schmeissen all the mitreisenden . </s>
<s> and that &apos;s what we did . </s>
<s> we got rid of the light , put it in a vacuum and they saugten it up to almost right now , in the elevator , with the piece of metal that was free to behave as never as it was . </s>
<s> so we measured its movement . </s>
<s> we found it was really strange moving . </s>
<s> instead of saying it &apos;s just been there , vibrierte it . the way it vibrierte was kind of like this -- like a ausdehnender and to do lunch [coll.] blasebalg . </s>
<s> in which we gave him a small push , we were able to to judder it at the same time and to judder it -- something that is allowed in quantum mechanics . </s>
<s> so what i &apos;m telling you is something fantastic . </s>
<s> what does it mean to to judder to an object at the same time and not vibrate ? </s>
<s> let &apos;s think about atoms . </s>
<s> so the first is : all the tens of atoms that are taking the piece of metal is still there , and at the same time , the same atoms are moving up and down . </s>
<s> it &apos;s just about basic sexual voices . </s>
<s> the rest of the time they are delocalised  [Br.] . </s>
<s> this means that every atom at the same time is two different places , which means that the entire piece of metal is in two different places . </s>
<s> i think that &apos;s really cool . </s>
<s> really . </s>
<s> it &apos;s worth me for all this year in the clean room , because , check that , the massstabsunterschied between a single atom , and this piece of metal is just like the difference between the metal and with them . </s>
<s> so if a single atom can be at the same time in two different places , this piece of metal can be two different places , why not it ? </s>
<s> i mean , that &apos;s just what my logical page says . </s>
<s> so , imagine , you would be at the same time in multiple places , how would it feel ? </s>
<s> how would your mind be concerned that your body is delocalised  [Br.] in the room ? </s>
<s> there &apos;s another aspect in history . </s>
<s> when we aufwärmten the light and reinschauten the box , we saw that the piece of metal was always there in a piece . </s>
<s> and so , i had to develop this new intuition that it looks like all the objects in your elevator , in fact , are only quanten objects that are together in a small room . </s>
<s> you hear a lot of talk about how mechanics says that everything is connected to everything . </s>
<s> now , that &apos;s not exactly right . </s>
<s> there &apos;s more over , it &apos;s still deeper . </s>
<s> it &apos;s such that these connections , their connections with all of the things around them , are literally defined who they are , and that &apos;s the tiefsinnige and the to produce strange effects . </s>
<s> thank you . </s>
<s> in 2007 , i decided we should think of rekonzeptualisieren as we think about economic development . </s>
<s> it should be our goal that if families want to think about where they are living and they want to work , they wanted to give you the opportunity between at least a hand of different cities that are all in competition for new people . </s>
<s> at the moment , we are far away from this goal . </s>
<s> there are billions of people in developing countries who don &apos;t even give up a single city that they &apos;ll be welcome to . </s>
<s> but the amazing thing about cities is that they are so much more value than it costs it . </s>
<s> so what we could do is very easy to with a vengeance , maybe even hundreds of new cities . </s>
<s> now this may sound absurd for you , unless you thought about new cities . </s>
<s> just trade the building of homes versus cities . </s>
<s> imagine the half of the people who want to live in homes , they tried it ; it &apos;s not the other half . </s>
<s> you could try to expand the capacity of these existing grains of homes . </s>
<s> but you know what you would be going to get into , in those homes and the environment , use laws to avoid grievances and push off . </s>
<s> so it turns out to be very difficult to meet all this broad day . </s>
<s> but you could go in a whole new place to build a whole new block block , imagine the laws that would give you a building and not existing it . </s>
<s> so what i proposed is that governments are creating new surfaces that offer enough space for a city and give you a name , charter cities . </s>
<s> later , i found out that , around the same time , javier and octavio have thought about the challenge of reform . </s>
<s> they knew that each year they knew that each year would leave their country to go back to the united states , and they wanted to know what they could do to make sure that these people can stay in their country and can do exactly the same thing in honduras . </s>
<s> and in this place , javier said , &quot; what happens if we want to go through one of the american embassy , which is a piece of the canadian botschaft- , what if we just want to go there and go to an non-ecumene [uninhabited regions] component of the canadian rules , or the united states , can you work there , and can you do anything on the surface of
<s> in 2009 , honduras was suffering from a major verfassungskrise . </s>
<s> in the next planmäßigen election , pepe lobo , he won pepe lobo in a reversal that promised both innovation and schlichtung . </s>
<s> he asked octavio to become his stabschef . </s>
<s> in the meantime , i prepared a talk at tedglobal . </s>
<s> so improvement , trial and through consumers , i tried to reduce this complicated concept of the charter city . </s>
<s> the first point , is the importance of laws , laws that determine that you &apos;re not allowed to be a to blanket out . </s>
<s> we add to pay for new kinds of tools , but for progress , we need technology and laws , and they &apos;re usually laws that help us . </s>
<s> in the fall of 2010 , a friend friend schickte sent the link to the tedtalk . </s>
<s> he showed him javier . </s>
<s> they call me up . </s>
<s> and they said , &quot; let &apos;s put that to the head of our country ! &quot; </s>
<s> so we met in december at december of a dance in miami . </s>
<s> and i &apos;ve tried to be very concerned about how valuable cities are , how much more valuable they are than they cost . </s>
<s> and i &apos;ve been using this graph to show how valuable rohland is at a place like new york . think that any area in some cases per square meter worth thousands of dollars . </s>
<s> but it was a rather abstract discussion , where there was a pause when there was a pause , octavio said , &quot; paul , let &apos;s see the tedtalk . &quot; </s>
<s> so the tedtalk , in very simple form , is that a charter city is a place where it &apos;s the beginning of unoccupied building land , which is a gründungsvertrag , which defines the laws that are there and the ability to decide to people , to either hold under these rules . </s>
<s> that &apos;s why i was asked by the president of honduras , who said we need to make this project that it &apos;s important , and that it &apos;s the path to bring our country forward . </s>
<s> i was asked to come to tegucigalpa and hold on the fourth and fifth of january . </s>
<s> so , i &apos;ve kept an example of gefüllten talk , which has an image like this , trying to make sure that if you want to create much value in a city , it has to be a very large city . </s>
<s> this is a picture of the city denver , and the sketch is the new airport , represented in denver . </s>
<s> it has an area of 100 quadratkilometern . </s>
<s> so what i &apos;ve been trying to convince about is to convince the honduraner if you want to build a new city , to start with an area of at least 1,000 quadratkilometern . </s>
<s> that &apos;s more than 250 thousand acres . </s>
<s> polite , all applauded . </s>
<s> the audience &apos;s faces were very serious and aware . </s>
<s> the director of the mind came onstage and said , &quot; professor romer , thank you so much for your talk , but maybe we could look at the tedtalk . </s>
<s> i &apos;ve got it on my laptop . &quot; </s>
<s> so i sat down , and they played the tedtalk . </s>
<s> and i came to the punch line that a new city offers people new possibilities . </s>
<s> it would have been able to live in a city that would be honduras , instead of hundreds of miles away from north . </s>
<s> and a new city includes new opportunities for leaders . </s>
<s> the leaders of the government &apos; leaders rely on their help from partnerländern , they could benefit from their partnerländern that they would use by making the laws for this charter for this charter for this charter , and that it turns out that everybody can trust that the charter is actually going off . </s>
<s> and the lesson of president lobo was that the confidence of the durchsetzung that i was thinking about as a way to bring the foreign investors to rebuild and to build the city would be possible for all the parties for all parties , who have been suffering for fear and mistrust . </s>
<s> we &apos;re in an area . </s>
<s> this picture is from this place . </s>
<s> it seems about a thousand square kilometers . </s>
<s> and shortly after that , at the 19th of january , you voted with congress for a change for a change of the constitution to have a verfassungsgemäße regelung that &apos;s in particular for certain entwicklungsgebiete . </s>
<s> in a country that has just been a genuine crisis , in congress for that verfassungsänderung to a voice to a voice . </s>
<s> all parties , all the fraktionen of society , gave up this . </s>
<s> to be part of the constitution , it has to be twice-accepted by congress . </s>
<s> on december 17th , it turned out to be approved to a voice . </s>
<s> immediately after this election , between the 21st war and june in february , a delegation of about 30 and a half hunduranern to the two places in the world most of them were interested in the business of städtebaus . </s>
<s> this is south korea . </s>
<s> this is an image from a large new institution , which is built in south korea , much more than the center . </s>
<s> everything you can see in this picture was built within four years , after it took four years , to get the occupation . </s>
<s> the other place that was very interested in transportation is singapore . </s>
<s> there were two cities built in china , and the third is in preparation . </s>
<s> so in handy , if you think about it , it &apos;s where we are today . </s>
<s> you already have a baugrundstück , and you &apos;re looking at this space for the second city . </s>
<s> it &apos;s already worked on a legal system that managern is allowing , and it &apos;s worked on an external system . </s>
<s> a country has already been able to put its supreme court on its top for the entgültige appeal of the dortigen system . </s>
<s> and -bauer and -bauer are very interested . </s>
<s> they even get funding . </s>
<s> one of the things you already know about , there &apos;s been a lot of mieter . </s>
<s> there are lots of businesses that would love to be in america , especially in a place with a freihandelszone , and there &apos;s a lot of people who &apos;d like to live there . </s>
<s> all over the world , there are 700 million people who say that they want to live continuously in another place . </s>
<s> a million people left every year and go back to the united states . </s>
<s> a lot of them are fathers who are forced to leave their families , to zurückzulassen their families , sometimes they &apos;re single mothers who need to make enough money to be food and clothing . </s>
<s> unfortunately , sometimes it &apos;s children who are trying to find their parents again , which they , in some cases , haven &apos;t seen any more . </s>
<s> so what is it for an idea of thinking about a whole new city ? </s>
<s> or even duzende duzende from all over the world ? </s>
<s> so what is it for an idea that every family has a choice between a number of cities that are in competition for new citizens ? </s>
<s> this is an idea worth spreading . </s>
<s> my friends &apos; friends asked me to say , thank you ted . </s>
<s> you know how many of you do you make in a typical day ? </s>
<s> you know how many of decisions do you meet in a typical week ? </s>
<s> i recently made a poll with over 2,000 americans , and the average number of choices , the angabegemäß of a typical american person on a day is 70. . </s>
<s> it was also done recently a study with lawyers , where they saw the ceos for a week . </s>
<s> and these scientists have simply documented the different topics with these ceos , and how much time they were trying to make decisions that relate with things . </s>
<s> and what they &apos;ve found out is that an average ceo , in the week , worked with 139 tasks . </s>
<s> each of these subjects , of course , was of many , many smaller decisions . </s>
<s> fifty percent of their choices were within nine minutes or less hit . </s>
<s> only for about 12 percent of their decisions , they took an hour or more of their time . </s>
<s> think of your own decisions . </s>
<s> do you know how many decisions you can meet in the nine minutes in the nine minutes ? </s>
<s> how good do you think they &apos;re dealing with it ? </s>
<s> today , i want to talk about one of the great entscheidungsprobleme of our modern era , the entscheidungsüberlastungsproblem . </s>
<s> i want to talk about the problem and about some possible solutions . </s>
<s> now , when i &apos;m talking about this problem , i &apos;m going to ask you some questions , and i want to know your answers . </s>
<s> if i ask you a question , raise it because i &apos;m blind , only your hand , if you want to burn some calories . </s>
<s> otherwise , i ask you , if i ask you a question , and your answer is , well , my first question today is : are you willing to hear something about the entscheidungsüberlastungsproblem ? </s>
<s> thank you . </s>
<s> when i was a abschlussstudent at stanford university , i went to this very like shelling peas [Br.] store , at least it was really exclusive . </s>
<s> it was a store called draeger . </s>
<s> this business , it was almost like a vergnügungspark . </s>
<s> they had 250 different kinds of mustard and essig and over 500 different kinds of fruits and vegetables and more than two dozen different kinds of water -- and that was at a time when we actually drink leitungswasser . </s>
<s> i loved it to go to that business , but at a time , i asked myself , well , how did you get something kaufst ? </s>
<s> here &apos;s the olive gait . </s>
<s> they had 75 different kinds of oil , including those that were embedded in boxes that were found by a thousand years old olivenbäumen . </s>
<s> so one day i decided to go to see the leader , and i asked the ladder , &quot; does this model work that you really offer all of these possibilities ? &quot; </s>
<s> and he showed up the busladungen of tourists that came together every day , and they typically had their cameras . </s>
<s> we decided to do an experiment , and we chose marmelade for our experiment . </s>
<s> here &apos;s her marmeladen gait . </s>
<s> they had 348 kinds of marmelade . </s>
<s> we &apos;ve set up a little verkostungsecke right down at the eingang . </s>
<s> we &apos;ve got six different intuitions in there , or 24 different intuitions , and we &apos;ve looked at two things : firstly , what if we were going to have a lot of people left and marmelade ? </s>
<s> there were more people left when there were 24 percent , about 60 percent than if six , about 40 percent . </s>
<s> and that &apos;s what we looked at at what case that people bought a glass of marmelade . </s>
<s> now we saw the opposite effect . </s>
<s> from the people who were stayed when it was 24 , only three percent actually bought . </s>
<s> from the people who stayed when they were six , well , we saw that 30 percent of them actually bought a glass of marmelade . </s>
<s> well , if you calculate it , people buy six times a glass of glass , which they had six to choice when they had 24 to vote . </s>
<s> well , not to buy glass of glass is probably good for us to buy -- at least it &apos;s good for our taille -- but it turns out that the entscheidungsüberlastungsproblem is affecting us with very sophisticated decisions . </s>
<s> we don &apos;t choose to decide , even though it comes against our best self-interest . </s>
<s> so , the issue of the day : financial savings . </s>
<s> so i &apos;m going to describe to you now a study that i did with gur huberman , emir jang jang , where we were doing decisions for an almost of a million americans from about 650 plans in the entire united states . </s>
<s> and what we were looking at was whether the number of fondsangebote that were possible to a rentensparplan , the 401 plan , would be influenced to be able to be saved more for tomorrow . </s>
<s> and we found that there was a correlation in it . </s>
<s> so in these plans , we &apos;ve had about 657 plans that offered people in anything between two to 59 years . </s>
<s> and what we found out was that , the more funding have been offered that , in fact , that was lower rate . </s>
<s> now if you look at the extremes now , the plans , the plans , the two plans , they had a teilnahmerate in the &apos; 70s -- still not as high as we want . </s>
<s> in the plans , which was almost 60 fonds , the teilnahmerate fell down to about the sechzigsten prozentanteil . </s>
<s> now it turns out that even when they &apos;re engaged in their own lives , if there were more opportunities for choice , even then , it has negative consequences . </s>
<s> so the people who join themselves would be more of the fact that the more opportunities that were available to them , the more we encourage it aktien and fonds . </s>
<s> the more opportunities they got , the more they put their entire money in pure geldmarktkonten . </s>
<s> none of these extreme choices belongs to the choices that someone would recommend people if they care about their future financial . </s>
<s> well , in the last 10 years , we &apos;ve seen three major negative consequences that require more and more choice . </s>
<s> they push the decision -- push up , even when it &apos;s going to do their best interest . </s>
<s> they make worse decisions -- negative financial and 99 medical decisions . </s>
<s> they decide to be more of things that they give themselves less content , even when they make it objective better . </s>
<s> the reason for that is that we might enjoy this huge gathering line of mayonaise , mustard , essig and marmelade , but in fact , we can &apos;t pull in comparison and abgrenzungen , and then we can actually choose something from the fantastic supply . </s>
<s> so what i &apos;m going to suggest to you today is four simple techniques -- techniques that we &apos;ve tested in different ways and different kinds of dna that they can apply in their business . </s>
<s> first of all , close . </s>
<s> you &apos;ve heard it before , but it &apos;s never true than today that is less . </s>
<s> people are always worried , &quot; close . &quot; </s>
<s> they &apos;re always worried that they lose regalfläche . </s>
<s> but in truth , we see it more and more and more that if you &apos;re willing to get close to yourself , and the unwichtigen gleichartigen opportunities are going to be coming , well , there &apos;s a rise of sales , it &apos;s continue to be ... the costs , &amp; amp ; and there &apos;s an improvement . </s>
<s> as proctor and gamble , the different head of justice and shoulders have decreased the to differ in age species of 26 meters , they found a rise of sales by sales . </s>
<s> as the golden cat corporation , they sold 10 to 10 percent of the best known by katzenstreus loswurde , and they found that the gains for 87 percent -- a result of two , the rise of sales and reducing reducing costs . </s>
<s> you know , the average supermakrt today , it gives you 45,000 products . </s>
<s> a typical wal-mart offers you today 100,000 products today . </s>
<s> but the ninth largest supermarket that are now ninth largest supermarket today is aldi , and they &apos;re only offering 1,400 products -- a kind of tomato sauce . </s>
<s> now , in the world of sparens , i think one of the best examples that came on to the market recently , it was about the way that david laibson has been , something that david laibson has very much mitgestaltet , it &apos;s a program that &apos;s offered at harvard . </s>
<s> every single harvard , now , in a single , individual part . </s>
<s> those of the people who want to make a choice , get 20 plans , not 300 or more . </s>
<s> you know , as people often say , &quot; i don &apos;t know how to do it . </s>
<s> it &apos;s all important possibilities . &quot; </s>
<s> and the first thing that i ask the employee is , &quot; tell me how the possibilities are different from each other . </s>
<s> and if your employees can &apos;t to be able to distinguish you , your customers can &apos;t . &quot; </s>
<s> now , before we started lunch today , i had a conversation with gary . </s>
<s> and then gary , he said that he would be willing to put all of the people in this audience to offer all-inklusive bezahlten vacation . </s>
<s> here &apos;s a description of the road . </s>
<s> and i want to read you that . </s>
<s> and i &apos;m going to give you a couple of seconds now to read you , and then i ask you to clap when you &apos;re willing to take gary &apos;s supply . </s>
<s> okay . every one of that is to take gary &apos; supply . </s>
<s> are that everybody ? </s>
<s> well , let me show you a little bit more about this . </s>
<s> they knew it was a trick in it , right ? </s>
<s> well , who &apos;s ready for this journey . </s>
<s> i think i &apos;ve heard more hands . </s>
<s> good . </s>
<s> in fact , that &apos;s what she looks at , the first time that i had more information , than the second time , but i would make it a car that they thought it was a second time . </s>
<s> because the images made it real for them . </s>
<s> which brings me to the second technology that help you with the problem of entscheidungsüberlastung , it &apos;s the konkretisierung . </s>
<s> it &apos;s about that people who need to understand the difference between opportunities , to understand what consequences are associated with the individual opportunities , and those consequences have to be relative and specific . </s>
<s> why are people on average 15 to 30 percent more when they &apos;re using a ec-karte or a credit card ? </s>
<s> because it doesn &apos;t really feel money . </s>
<s> and it turns out that if you manage to make things concrete , it &apos;s a very good tool , so you get people to save more . </s>
<s> so what we did in a study that i did with shlomo benartzi and alessandro previtero , we &apos;ve done a study with people at ing -- employees who worked for ing -- and those people were all in one gathering where they signed their participation for their rentensparplan . </s>
<s> and during this gathering , we &apos;ve got to go back to the same way that they &apos;ve always been , we put a little bit more . </s>
<s> the kind of little thing we &apos;ve been asked to do is we asked people to just think of all the positive things that would happen in their lives if they &apos;d save money . </s>
<s> in which we did this simple thing , there was a rise of participation around 20 percent , and there was a rise of the number of people who were willing to save , or to go by four percent by the amount that they were willing to pay for . </s>
<s> third technology : kategorisierung . </s>
<s> we can make better with more categories than with more choices . </s>
<s> here &apos;s an example of a study that we did in a zeitschriftengang . </s>
<s> it turns out that in the wegmans supermärkten , the top in the north area , the number of 331 revealed different kinds of magazines from to the power of (ten) . </s>
<s> but you know what ? </s>
<s> if i &apos;m going to show you 600 magazines and i &apos;m going to show you in 10 categories , or i &apos;m going to show you 400 magazines , and i &apos;ve been showing you 400 magazines , you believe that i &apos;ve given you more choices and a better auswahlerfahrung , when i &apos;ve given them to give you 600 . </s>
<s> because the categories tell me how to keep it apart . </s>
<s> so here &apos;s two different schmuckauslagen . </s>
<s> one is called &quot; jazz , &quot; and the other is &quot; swing . &quot; </s>
<s> if you think the left display is swing , and the display on the right is jazz , then they &apos;re clapping . </s>
<s> okay , there &apos;s a couple . </s>
<s> if you think that the one on the left is jazz , and the one on the right is swing on the right , please clap . </s>
<s> okay , a couple more . </s>
<s> well it turns out they &apos;re right . </s>
<s> the one on the left is jazz , and the one on the right is swing , but you know what ? </s>
<s> this is a high grade kategorisierungsschema . </s>
<s> the categories have to say something about it , not the selection of voting . </s>
<s> and they often see this problem when they look at all of these plans . </s>
<s> who do you want to inform with this ? </s>
<s> my fourth technology : fantasy of complexity . </s>
<s> it turns out that we can actually deal with more information than we think we need to simplify it . </s>
<s> we need to increase complexity slowly . </s>
<s> let me give you an example of what i mean . </s>
<s> let &apos;s take a very , very complicated decision : buy a car . </s>
<s> this is a german autohersteller that allows you to to configurate your car . </s>
<s> they have to make 62 different decisions to design their car completely . </s>
<s> now , these decisions are different from the number of choices that they offer in any decision . </s>
<s> autofarben , außenfarbe of the car -- i &apos;ve got 56 options . </s>
<s> motors , getriebe -- four options . </s>
<s> what i &apos;m doing now is i change the order of the choices . </s>
<s> half of customers is going to go from the many possibilities , 56 autofarben to the low possibilities , four getriebe . </s>
<s> the other half of the customers go from the low opportunities , four getriebe , to the 56 autofarben , many possibilities . </s>
<s> what do i look at ? </s>
<s> how do you care ? </s>
<s> and if you &apos;re using the standardauswahl of the decision , that means that you get overwhelmed , the heisste , i &apos;m sick . </s>
<s> what you find out is that the people who always go through the few auswahlmöglichkteiten are always going to go and choose the standardauswahl . </s>
<s> we lose them . </s>
<s> go from the little choice of the people , then stay with it . </s>
<s> it &apos;s the same information . it &apos;s the same number of possibilities . </s>
<s> the only thing i did , the sequence is changing in this information . </s>
<s> when i start with the easy process , i study how i am . </s>
<s> even though the gears choose to choose me nothing about my preferences in the interior , it still makes me pick it up . </s>
<s> it also staggered me into a lot of the great product that i &apos;m looking for , so i &apos;m willing to motivate myself to be more interested with this . </s>
<s> let me wrap up . </s>
<s> i &apos;ve told you about four techniques that to allay the problem of entscheidungsüberlastung -- close -- you &apos;re going to go through the überflüssigen alternatives ; to concrete -- you make it real ; to categorise [Br.] -- we can go better with more categories , fewer possibilities . </s>
<s> any of these techniques that i &apos;d been talking to you today about is to help you manage the possibilities -- well for you , you can use them for yourself , good for the people who do . </s>
<s> because i think the key to the best choice is that you &apos;re clear in voting . </s>
<s> and the more we are selected with choices , the better we will be able to practice the art of choice . </s>
<s> thank you . </s>
<s> hi . i &apos;m kevin allocca , trends-manager with youtube . i look at youtube-videos . </s>
<s> that &apos;s true . </s>
<s> today we want to talk about what videos are going to be like , and then , that &apos;s what it &apos;s all about . </s>
<s> we all want to be symmetrical , berühmtheiten , sänger , comedians -- when i was young , it seemed so infinite . </s>
<s> but webvideos have enabled that all of us , or all of our creative activities , can be well-known in a part of the culture of our world . </s>
<s> every single one of you could be in the internet by next saturday . </s>
<s> but in youtube , more than 48 hours of video are uploaded a minute . </s>
<s> it &apos;s going to viral a tiny percentage of it , and it &apos;s beginning to look thousands of times and look at the cultural moment . </s>
<s> so how does it work ? </s>
<s> three things : tastemaker , teilnahmecommunities and unexpected . </s>
<s> well , we want to go . </s>
<s> oh my god . oh my god . </s>
<s> oh my god ! </s>
<s> woah ! </s>
<s> ohhhhh , wowwww ! </s>
<s> last year , sendete bear vasquez was shot this video that was shot in the european park . </s>
<s> in 2010 , it was very 23 million times . </s>
<s> this graph shows what it looked like when the video was first popular . </s>
<s> actually , bear video didn &apos;t want to do viral video . </s>
<s> he just wanted to share a rainbow . </s>
<s> because that &apos;s what you do when you &apos;re called yosemite mountain bear . </s>
<s> he uploaded lots of naturvideos . </s>
<s> and this video was actually sent up in january . </s>
<s> what happened here ? </s>
<s> so , jimmy kimmel . </s>
<s> jimmy kimmel sendete the tweet that did the video so popular . </s>
<s> because tastemaker like jimmy kimmel make us new and interesting things , and show up a big audience . </s>
<s> it &apos;s friday , friday friday . gotta gotta be s forward to the weekend , everybody &apos;s looking at looking at looking at looking at looking at friday . gettin &apos; looking at the to be (down) in the dumps [coll.] . you didn &apos;t imagine we &apos;re going to go that conversation without talking about this entertainment without talking about this video . </s>
<s> rebecca blacks &apos;s &quot; friday &quot; is one of the populärsten videos of the year . </s>
<s> it &apos;s been seen in nearly 200 million times this year . </s>
<s> this is what the chart looked like . </s>
<s> just like &quot; double rainbow , &quot; it seems like not to be . </s>
<s> what happened in that day ? </s>
<s> well , it was friday , that &apos;s true . </s>
<s> if you want to know , these other tips are also freitage . </s>
<s> but what about that day , this particular friday ? </s>
<s> well , tosh.0 , gabelte , they started writing about it . </s>
<s> michael j. , of the mystery of mystery theater , was a first first one who did a joke on twitter . </s>
<s> it &apos;s important that an individual or a group of tastemakers would take a point with a large audience with a large audience . </s>
<s> and then this community of people who shared these large insiderwitz , and started talking about it and herumzuspielen it . </s>
<s> now , there are 10,000 parodien from friday &apos;s youtube . </s>
<s> for the first seven days , it was a parodie for every single week . </s>
<s> unlike the einseitigen entertainment of the 20th century , the participation of our community is our way to become part of this phenomenon -- either by making it spread or do something new . </s>
<s> nyan cat &apos;s animation and music in endlosschleife . </s>
<s> that &apos;s it , very simple . </s>
<s> it became an almost 50 million times this year . </s>
<s> and if you keep that for mad , you should know that there &apos;s a dreistundenversion that has been looking at four million times . </s>
<s> even cats watch this video . </s>
<s> cats look at cats , looking at this video . </s>
<s> it &apos;s important , the creativity that &apos;s in the internetkultur of techies and geeks . </s>
<s> there were remixe . </s>
<s> somebody did an old-fashioned version of it . </s>
<s> and then it became international . </s>
<s> an entire remix-gemeinde shot out of the ground that made it from a stupid joke to something that we can all participate on . </s>
<s> today , we don &apos;t just find attention to something , we do with it . </s>
<s> who could have this to anticipate ? </s>
<s> who would have &quot; double rainbow &quot; or rebecca black or &quot; nyan cat &apos;s &quot; can predict ? &quot; </s>
<s> what kind of drehbücher could it be able to write in the so not cool [coll.] ? </s>
<s> in a world where every minute has two days of video , it can only be unique and unexpected to be prominent , like listening videos . </s>
<s> i &apos;m not really interested . i wasn &apos;t really interested in being a friend told me that when i was a friend , i was going to look at this wonderful video over a guy in new york for strafzettel . </s>
<s> i got a ticket because i &apos;m not on the radweg , but often , there aren &apos;t a lot of disabilities that are going to go to the radweg . </s>
<s> this is something that was surprisingly surprising and humorous , and he was looking at eight million times . </s>
<s> this approach is true for anything new we do creative . </s>
<s> and it all leads to this one big question . </s>
<s> what does that mean ? </s>
<s> ohhhh . </s>
<s> what does that mean ? </s>
<s> tastemaker , creative teilnehmergemeinden , fully unexpected , are the characteristics of a new kind of media and culture that everybody has access to , and in the audience , that the audience popularität . </s>
<s> like i said , one of the biggest stars -- justin bieber -- did his start with youtube . </s>
<s> nobody has to give your ideas green light . </s>
<s> and today , we all feel as owners of our culture culture . </s>
<s> and these are not the characteristics of the old media , and they &apos;re also getting to the media of today , but they will determine the entertainment of the future . </s>
<s> thank you . </s>
<s> how can i talk about three generations over three generations , and how the astonishing power of that connectedness was in the lives of a four-year-old girl , their mother and their grandmother were going five days and never disappeared . </s>
<s> history is not over . </s>
<s> she &apos;s a puzzle one , which is composed (of) . </s>
<s> i want to tell you about some of the puzzlestückchen . </s>
<s> think of the first piece : a guy burning his lebenswerk . </s>
<s> he &apos;s a poet , a writer , a man , whose entire life , of the simple hope of oneness and freedom . </s>
<s> think of it as the einmarsch of the kommunisten in saigon , as he must say that his life had been a single waste . </s>
<s> the words , that &apos;s how long his friends , spotteten now . </s>
<s> he moved to silence . </s>
<s> he died , broke through history . </s>
<s> he &apos;s my grandfather . </s>
<s> i never met him personally . </s>
<s> but our lives are so much more than our memories . </s>
<s> my grandmother never let my life forget . </s>
<s> and i had to worry that it wasn &apos;t free for free , and it was my job to learn that the history tried to be able to to crush us , but we ran it through . </s>
<s> the next puzzleteil shows how a boat in the early morgenrot yellow on lake . </s>
<s> my mother may was 18 when her father died -- already in an arrangierten marriage , with two little girls . </s>
<s> for her , she had asked her a task : the flucht of her family and a new life in australia . </s>
<s> it was completely except that she could fail with it . </s>
<s> after a vierjährigen and filmreifen saga , a boat to be quiet on the lake as fischerboot camouflaged . </s>
<s> all the adults were aware of the risks . </s>
<s> the biggest fear of them , they had pirates , rape and death . </s>
<s> like most adults on the boat , my mother wore a little giftflasche . </s>

<s> after three months in a refugee camp , we landed in melbourne . </s>

<s> my mother worked on farms , then on a line of autofabrik , six days , double reading layers . </s>
<s> it allowed you to get the time to find english and it-qualifikationen . </s>
<s> we were poor . </s>
<s> every dollar has been given , and was put in more education for english and mathematics , no matter what we had to give for it , and most of the time the new stuff came out of second hand . </s>
<s> two strümpfe for school , each one to cover the holes in the other . </s>
<s> one schuluniform to the knöcheln , because she had to go for six years . </s>
<s> and there was the rare but painful chöre from &quot; schlitzauge , &quot; and here and speaking of ... , &quot; asiaten , go home . &quot; </s>
<s> home . </s>
<s> something versteifte me . </s>
<s> there was a meeting to the reconciliation and a quiet voice said , &quot; i &apos;m going to go out of my path . &quot; </s>
<s> my mom , my sister and i fall in the same bed . </s>
<s> my mom was exhausted every night , but we told each other from our day and listened to the movements of our grandmother in the house . </s>
<s> my mother was suffering of alpträumen from the boat . </s>
<s> and it was my job to stay awake every night , until her alpträume came up , so i could to arouse from sleep her . </s>
<s> she opened up a computergeschäft , and then she did a kosmetikerausbildung , and he ran a store . </s>
<s> and the women came with their stories about men who were not ertrugen and mad and inflexible and sorgenerfüllte children , trapped between two worlds . </s>
<s> loans and sponsoren were regarded . </s>
<s> centers were placed . </s>
<s> i was living in parallelwelten . </s>
<s> in one , i was the classic asian student , the grim determination cause himself . </s>
<s> in the other , i was involved in gifted life , the sad scars of the violence , the drogenmissbrauchs and the insulation . </s>
<s> but that &apos;s how many people were over . </s>
<s> and because of that help , i was born in my last year of jurastudiums as a young australierin of the year . </s>
<s> and i was catapulted by a puzzlestück to the next one , and the edges didn &apos;t fit together . </s>
<s> tan le , free bewohnerin of footscray , was now tan le , refugee and social activist , who was invited to speak of places that had never been heard of places that they never heard of . </s>
<s> i was not familiar with the etikette . </s>
<s> i didn &apos;t know how to use the besteck . </s>
<s> i didn &apos;t know how to talk about wine . </s>
<s> i didn &apos;t know how to talk about anything . </s>
<s> i wanted to go back to routine and the comfort of an unknown vororts -- a grandmother , a mother and two daughters , each of their days as abschlossen as the last 20 years , by telling each other &apos;s stories &apos; stories &apos; stories and einschliefen , we still told each other in the same bed . </s>
<s> i told my mother , i wouldn &apos;t do that . </s>
<s> she reminded me that i was so old , like , when we climbed up the boat . </s>
<s> no , no possibility has been there . </s>
<s> &quot; just say it , &quot; she said , &quot; it &apos;s not what you &apos;re not . &quot; </s>
<s> so i talked about jugendarbeitslosigkeit and education , and the vernachlässigung of marginalisierten and entrechteten . </s>
<s> and the more open i spoke , the more i should tell . </s>
<s> and i met people in all lebenslagen , so many of them did what they loved was what they loved , lived on the borders of the possible . </s>
<s> and even though i had a degree , i realized that i couldn &apos;t come into a career with a career . </s>
<s> there had to be another puzzlestück . </s>
<s> and i realized at the same time that it &apos;s okay to be a maverick , a neuankömmling , new picture -- and not just right , but something you need to be grateful , maybe a gift of the boots . </s>
<s> because dazuzugehören can have this kind of thing to collapse , can easily mean that you &apos;re convinced the assumptions of the environment . </s>
<s> now , i &apos;ve been going to go from my bequemlichkeitsbereich to know that , yes , the world auseinanderbricht , but not just how to keep it . </s>
<s> possibilities that would have been allowed , was explicitly encouraging . </s>
<s> there was a energy , an intentional optimism , a strange mixtur of the humility and the wagnisses . </s>
<s> so i decided to laugh . </s>
<s> i collected a small team of people around me , which the Seven Wonders of the (Ancient) World the schublade , &quot; a irresistible force challenge . </s>
<s> we didn &apos;t have a dime . </s>
<s> at the end of each one , i was eating a huge topf soup we shared . </s>
<s> we worked late to night . </s>
<s> most of our ideas were nuts , but it was a few brilliant with us , and we succeeded . </s>
<s> i made the decision to go into the u.s. </s>
<s> just a journey there . </s>
<s> my sleep again . </s>
<s> three months later , i was moved , and the adventure kept going on . </s>
<s> before i go through the talk , i want to tell you about my grandmother . </s>
<s> she grew up at a time when konfuzianismus was the social norm , and the local person was sleeping . </s>
<s> life had not changed since centuries . </s>
<s> her father died after her birth . </s>
<s> her mother would open her . </s>
<s> with 17 , she was given to the second woman of an excuse , whose mother suggested she . </s>
<s> for her husband , she took her for a sensation , where she brought it to court and anklägerin in her own case , and a larger sensation when she won . </s>
<s> &quot; it won &apos;t be . &quot; </s>
<s> i was just duschte in a hotel room in sydney , when she died . 1000 miles away in melbourne . </s>
<s> i looked around the duschtrennwand , and she looked at the other side . </s>
<s> i knew she was coming to say goodbye . </s>
<s> so my mother called me a few minutes afterwards . </s>
<s> a few days later , we went into a buddhist temple in footscray and sat around her sarg . </s>
<s> we told her stories and versicherten that we were still with it . </s>
<s> after midnight , the monk came and said he had to close the sarg . </s>
<s> my mother asked us to touch her hand . </s>
<s> she asked the monk , &quot; why is your hand so warm and the rest of you are so cold ? &quot; </s>
<s> &quot; because you say it since this morning , &quot; he said . </s>
<s> &quot; they didn &apos;t come out . &quot; </s>
<s> if there is a band in our family , it &apos;s about women . </s>
<s> you can see who we were and how life evolved us to us , we can now see that the men who might have come to our lives would have been coming to us . </s>
<s> it &apos;s been pregnant . </s>
<s> now i would have loved my own children , and i think of the boat . </s>
<s> who would ever wish ever ? </s>
<s> yeah , i &apos;m afraid of privilege , before berechtigungsanspruch . </s>
<s> can i give you a bug in your life , the courageous of any wave , trotzt , the unbeirrte , continuous continuation to chuff [engine] of the engine , the to dilate horizon , that nothing ? </s>
<s> i don &apos;t know . </s>
<s> but if i could give that , and you could certainly to bring through it , i would do it . </s>
<s> also , tans &apos;s mom is in the fourth one or the fifth row . </s>
<s> i &apos;m here to share my photography with you . </s>
<s> is it even photography ? </s>
<s> because this is , of course , a picture you can &apos;t pick with your camera . </s>
<s> nevertheless , my interest started in photography when i received my first digital camera at age 15 years old . </s>
<s> i dove it with my former repertoire for drawing , but it was a bit different , because using the camera , the actual process was actually in planning . </s>
<s> and if you take a picture with a camera , the end ends when you squeeze on the trigger . </s>
<s> so to me , it seemed more like this to be able to be at the right place at the right time . </s>
<s> i thought everybody could do that . </s>
<s> so i wanted to create something else , something that the process began when the event continues . </s>
<s> photos like this : a site along a much befahrenen road . </s>
<s> but it has an unexpected twist . </s>
<s> and yet , behaltet still a realistic plane . </s>
<s> or photos like this -- dark and brightly colored  [Am.] , but all of the lead goal to keep a realistic level </s>
<s> if i say reality , i do . </s>
<s> because , of course , it &apos;s not something that you can actually catch , but i want to make it look like this , in a photograph . </s>
<s> photographs where you need to think of a moment of thinking to find the trick . </s>
<s> so it &apos;s more about capturing an idea than a moment . </s>
<s> but what &apos;s the trick that makes it realistic look realistic ? </s>
<s> does it matter the detail or the colors ? </s>
<s> is it about the light ? </s>
<s> what creates the illusion ? </s>
<s> sometimes the perspective is the illusion . </s>
<s> but ultimately , it &apos;s about how we interpret the world and how it can be made on a two-dimensional basis . </s>
<s> it &apos;s not what &apos;s realistic , it &apos;s what we think is realistic . </s>
<s> so i think the essentials are very easy . </s>
<s> i see it as an issue of reality where you can take different pieces and put pieces together to create an alternative reality . </s>
<s> and let me show you just an example . </s>
<s> we have three perfect vorstellbare objects that we can all identify in a three-dimensional world . </s>
<s> but in a particular way , you can combine something that &apos;s still able to make it more three-dimensional than if it could exist . </s>
<s> but at the same time , we know that that &apos;s not possible . </s>
<s> so we &apos;re not to circumvent our brains , because our brain just doesn &apos;t make sense . </s>
<s> and i see the same process in combining photographs . </s>
<s> it &apos;s really about combining different realities . </s>
<s> so the things that make a picture realistic look , i think it &apos;s the things that we don &apos;t think about in our daily lives . </s>
<s> but if we combine photographs , it &apos;s really important to think about it , because , in fact , it &apos;s kind of false . </s>
<s> so i would say that there are three laws to obey three rules to get a more effective outcome . </s>
<s> as you can see , they &apos;re not three special images . </s>
<s> but together , you can combine something special like this . </s>
<s> so the first rule is that stack should have the same perspective . </s>
<s> secondly , you should have photos that have photos . </s>
<s> and those two images fulfill these two requirements -- left from the same altitude , and the same beleuchtungsart . </s>
<s> third , it &apos;s about making it possible to make it possible , where the individual images start and end up by combining it . </s>
<s> it &apos;s impossible to tell you how the picture was actually put together . </s>
<s> so , by looking color , contrast and cooling the edges to the individual images , photographic representation mängel , like feldtiefe , entsättigte colors and disorders , we to blur the boundaries between the various images , and they let it look like a single picture , even though an image actually affiliable hundreds of layers . </s>
<s> here &apos;s another example . </s>
<s> you might be thinking that this is just a landscape , and the bottom part is integrated . </s>
<s> but in fact , this picture is completely composed of pictures of photographs of different places . </s>
<s> and i personally finde. that it &apos;s easier to create a place than a place , because you don &apos;t have to go into any compromise with the ideas in his head . </s>
<s> but it requires a lot of planning . </s>
<s> and when i had this idea in the winter , i knew i needed several months to plan that would find different places for the pieces of the puzzle . </s>
<s> for example , the fish was made on a anglerausflug . </s>
<s> it &apos;s one in another place . </s>
<s> the unterwasser-teil comes from a quarry . </s>
<s> and yes , i even put the house up on the island in red umgefärbt to make it ugly look . </s>
<s> so , in order to get a realistisches outcome , it &apos;s seen from me in planning . </s>
<s> i always start with an sketch , an idea . </s>
<s> after that , it &apos;s about the combination of different images . </s>
<s> and here &apos;s every piece of calculated really well . </s>
<s> and if you take good pictures , the result can be pretty beautiful , and also quite realistic . </s>
<s> so it &apos;s all the tools that are available , and the only thing we are limited is our imagination . </s>
<s> thank you . </s>
<s> i &apos;d like to talk to you about why so many electronic gesundheits-projekte failed . </s>
<s> and i think the most important point is that we stopped talking to our patients . </s>
<s> and one of the things we introduced at the radboud-universität was to make a haupt-zuhörer . </s>
<s> they &apos;re not particularly scientific about it -- it &apos;s a cup of coffee or tea , and asks the patients , families , relatives , &quot; how is it ? </s>
<s> how can we help you ? &quot; </s>
<s> and we think we want to think that this is one of the main problems , why everybody -- maybe most of the electronic gesundheits-projekte have failed : because we stopped listening . </s>
<s> this is my wlan-waage . a very simple thing . </s>
<s> she has a button on her . </s>
<s> and every morning i do it . </s>
<s> and yeah , i have a job , as you might recognize . </s>
<s> i appointed my job at 95 lbs . </s>
<s> it works very easy : every time i leave on the scale , my data also send my google health . </s>
<s> and that &apos;s where you put it from my allgemeinarzt here , so it can be able to recognize where my gewichtsproblem is , and it &apos;s not just the moment where i &apos;m going to need cardiac intensive care unit <CICU> support or so , but also with a look at the past . </s>
<s> but there &apos;s something else . </s>
<s> maybe you &apos;re familiar with this , i &apos;ve got over 4,000 follower follower on twitter . </s>
<s> so every morning i turn on my wlan-waage and the people talking to me before i &apos;m sitting in the car , &quot; to lunch , just a small coat today , lucien . &quot; </s>
<s> but this is the jolliest thing that can happen , because this is the gruppenzwang , gruppenzwang , to help patients , because that could be deployed by obesity , or it could be patienten patients . </s>
<s> it could also be used to get people from their chairs , and to get them to play together any kind of game to control their health . </s>
<s> next week , this is coming on the market . </s>
<s> it &apos;s going to give up this little blutdruck-messgerät that you get on an iphone or something like that . </s>
<s> and it will enable people to measure food from home to send it to their doctor and share it for another one , for something more than 100 dollars . </s>
<s> at this point , the patients are coming in the game . they can &apos;t only be able to go back to control to their own ship , but you can also help the health care of the challenges that are before us , and the kostenexplosion of healthcare , twice demand , and so on . </s>
<s> make the methods that are easy to use , and begin with this one with these patients in the team . </s>
<s> and you can do that through these kinds of ways , but also through crowdsourcing . </s>
<s> and one of the things we did , i want to share with you through a short video . </s>
<s> we all have navigationssysteme in our cars . </s>
<s> maybe even in our mobile phones . </s>
<s> we know very much where all these drivers are around . </s>
<s> we still know one where all the gas stations are . </s>
<s> and sure , we can get fastfood-ketten . </s>
<s> but where would the next aed to help to help this patient ? </s>
<s> we have herumgefragt , and nobody knew it . </s>
<s> no one knew where to find the next life-saving measures aed . </s>
<s> so what did we do ? we did crowdsourcing in the netherlands . </s>
<s> we &apos;ve set up a website and asked an menschenmasse , &quot; if you see a aed , please share them with where it is , &quot; because sometimes it &apos;s closed in geschäftszeiten , of course . </s>
<s> and over 10,000 aeds have been born in the netherlands . </s>
<s> the next step was to find apps for it . </s>
<s> and we &apos;ve made a ipad-app . </s>
<s> we &apos;ve developed an app for layar , augmented reality to find these aeds . </s>
<s> and if you &apos;re in a city like maastricht and someone &apos;s zusammenbricht , you can use your iphone , and within the next couple of weeks you also have your microsoft-handy to find the next aed that can save your life . </s>
<s> and yet , we don &apos;t just want it to be a aed4u , like the product is called , but also experiment as aed4us . </s>
<s> and we want to bring this to a worldwide level . </s>
<s> and we &apos;re asking our colleagues around the world , from the other universities , to help us to help us behave like knotenpunkte to behave that aeds across the world . </s>
<s> and if you &apos;re in holiday and you &apos;re zusammenbricht , your own diet or somebody else , you can find a aed . </s>
<s> the other thing we want to do , is that companies around the world will help us with the bestätigung of these aeds . </s>
<s> they might be kurierdienste , or technicians for example , to make sure that the registered job-seekers aed is still in its place . </s>
<s> please , please help us and try to improve the health not only to improve but to take into your hand . </s>
<s> thank you . </s>
<s> today , i &apos;m going to report from unexpected discoveries . </s>
<s> i work in the solartechnologie-branche . </s>
<s> and my little startup idea is that we force ourselves by using ... </s>
<s> ... it &apos;s schenkt . </s>
<s> here &apos;s a short video of what we do . </s>
<s> oh . a moment . </s>
<s> it may be allowed to be driven . </s>
<s> now -- we can just to jump across that -- i &apos;ll just put the video . </s>
<s> no . </s>
<s> that &apos;s not ... </s>
<s> okay . </s>
<s> solartechnologie is ... </s>
<s> oh , my time has been over ? </s>
<s> okay . thank you . </s>
<s> so a couple of years ago , i started a program to get the stars in technology and design to take a year back and work in an environment that was pretty much what they actually hate , we made them work in government . </s>
<s> this program is called code for america , and it &apos;s a little bit like the friedenscorps for geeks . </s>
<s> we choose some fellows every year and we leave them with stadtverwaltungen . </s>
<s> instead of sending you to the third world , let &apos;s put it in rathäuser . </s>
<s> and they developed these fantastic apps working with urban employees . </s>
<s> but what they really do is to show what is possible today . </s>
<s> so they meet al . </s>
<s> al is a hydrant in the city boston . </s>
<s> it looks like he was looking for a date , but what he really was looking for is somebody who freischaufelt it when he &apos;s to be snowed in , because he knows he &apos;s not very good at the brandbekämpfung when he &apos;s covered by an meters of a snow . </s>
<s> how did he get started looking for these particular kinds of help ? </s>
<s> we had a team of diamonds last year in boston , using the code for america . </s>
<s> they were there in february , and it had a lot of snowed . </s>
<s> and what they realized was that the city never looked down the fire covers . </s>
<s> but one particular fellow , a guy named erik michaels-ober , did another figure , and that was the fact that the sidewalks were getting rid of schaufelten , right outside of them . </s>
<s> so he did what any good religious would do , he wrote an app . </s>
<s> it &apos;s a nice little app where you can adopt a fire hydrant . </s>
<s> you stimmst to him free when it schneit . </s>
<s> if you do that , you can give it a name , and he called the first al care . </s>
<s> if you don &apos;t do that , you can take away somebody &apos;s somebody . </s>
<s> so there &apos;s a nice little game dynamic . </s>
<s> this is a unique little app . </s>
<s> it &apos;s probably the smallest of the 21 apps that fellows wrote in the last year . </s>
<s> but she does something that no other regierungstechnologie does . </s>
<s> it &apos;s rapidly spreading . </s>
<s> there &apos;s this guy in the i.t. state in the united states , which has seen that he could use this app , not for snow , but to adopt the citizens of tsunami-sirenen . </s>
<s> it &apos;s very important that these tsunami-sirenen work , but people steal batteries . </s>
<s> so he got citizens to check her . </s>
<s> and then seattle decided seattle to use the app to clean the citizens to clean the verstopften . </s>
<s> and chicago has just introduced them so that people will freischaufeln the buergersteige when it schneit it . </s>
<s> we now know nine cities that are planning to use this app . </s>
<s> and it &apos;s very evident , organically , of course . </s>
<s> if you know something about regierungstechnologie , you know it doesn &apos;t usually do that . </s>
<s> the beschaffung of software takes a few years . </s>
<s> we had a team that last year worked on a project last year in boston , where three people needed two months . </s>
<s> it was about a way of trying to figure out what the right public schools are for their children . </s>
<s> we later told that if it would go over the normal channels , it took over two years , it took over two million dollars . </s>
<s> and that &apos;s still nothing . </s>
<s> there &apos;s a project right now in the central justiz that it costs two billion dollars , and it doesn &apos;t work . </s>
<s> and there are projects like this at every level of government . </s>
<s> so an app that &apos;s written in a couple of days , and then spreading by selbt , is a kind of shot before the ends of government . </s>
<s> it shows how government could work better -- no more than a private company , how many people think that it was supposed to be . </s>
<s> and not even like a technik-unternehmen , but rather like the internet itself . </s>
<s> and that means free access , which means open and productive . </s>
<s> and that &apos;s important . </s>
<s> but what &apos;s important about this app is that it represents a new generation that anpackt the problem of government -- not as the problem of an verknöcherten institution , but as a problem of collective action . </s>
<s> and this is a very good news , because it turns out that we are very well in the collective action with digital technology . </s>
<s> now there &apos;s a great community of people who make the tools that we need in order to perform things together . </s>
<s> it &apos;s not just code for america &apos; diamonds , there &apos;s hundreds of people across the country that write up and regierungs-apps every day in their own communities . </s>
<s> they didn &apos;t give up government . </s>
<s> they &apos;re awful frustrated with her , but they don &apos;t complain about it , they fix it . </s>
<s> and these people know what we &apos;ve lost from the eyes . </s>
<s> and that &apos;s when you all have your feelings about politics and the snake in the arbeitsamt and all the other things that we &apos;re really upset about is government , in the core words , in the words of tim o reilly , &quot; what we can do together is not what we can do alone . &quot; </s>
<s> today , a lot of people have left government . </s>
<s> and if you &apos;re one of those people , i &apos;m going to tell you that you &apos;re nachdenkst about it because things are changing . </s>
<s> politics doesn &apos;t change ; the government is changing . </s>
<s> and because the government ended up getting their power from us -- erinner to them , &quot; we &apos;re the people ? &quot; -- how we think about it will affect how this transition happens . </s>
<s> i didn &apos;t know much about government when i started this program . </s>
<s> and like a lot of people , i thought it &apos;s mostly about the government to choose people in a office . </s>
<s> now after two years , i came to the conclusion that it was most of all at the local communities to go beutelratten . </s>
<s> this is the call for service and information . </s>
<s> that &apos;s where you normally get out when you put 311 in your city . </s>
<s> if you have to have the chance to go in your urban area call , like our fellow scott silverman as part of the program -- in fact , you &apos;re all doing this -- you &apos;re going to see that the people who call government for a lot of different problems , including that they &apos;re in their house . </s>
<s> so , scott gets this anfruf . </s>
<s> it tippt the database . </s>
<s> and he didn &apos;t really have an idea . he starts with the tierfänger . </s>
<s> and finally , he says , &quot; look , can you just open all the doors in your house and play very sounds music and see if the livestock are abhaut ? &quot; </s>
<s> and that worked . applause for scott . </s>
<s> but that was not the end of the beutelratten . </s>
<s> boston , it &apos;s not just a text call . </s>
<s> it has an app , a web- and handy-app , called &quot; citizens connect . &quot; </s>
<s> we didn &apos;t write that app . </s>
<s> this is the work of very smart people at the office of new urban mechanics . </s>
<s> one day -- this is an actual proper report , which is , &quot; beutelratte in my mülltonne . can &apos;t tell if she &apos;s dead . </s>
<s> how do i get her removed ? &quot; </s>
<s> but what happens to &quot; citizens connect &quot; is different . </s>
<s> scott talked about human beings . </s>
<s> but it &apos;s all public to advertise publicly , so anybody can see it . </s>
<s> and in this case , it was a neighbor . </s>
<s> and the next point we got was , &quot; i went over , i found the mülltonne behind the house . </s>
<s> beutelratte ? yes . alive ? yap . </s>
<s> drehte the site . went home . </s>
<s> good night , sweet beutelratte . &quot; </s>
<s> pretty simple . </s>
<s> this is great . this is where digital digital is true . </s>
<s> and it &apos;s also a good example of how to get the government into that crowdsourcing . </s>
<s> but it &apos;s also a great example of the government as a platform . </s>
<s> and i don &apos;t necessarily mean this technical definition of the platform . </s>
<s> i &apos;m talking more about a platform for people to help themselves and to help others . </s>
<s> a surgeon helped another citizen , but the government was going to be a central role . </s>
<s> they connected these two people . </s>
<s> and you could be able to connect them with state services if they were necessary , but a neighbor is a much better and cheaper alternative services . </s>
<s> if a neighbor helps the other , we strengthen our communities . </s>
<s> call the tierfänger , it costs a lot of money . </s>
<s> one of the most important things is that we need to think that government is not the same as politics . </s>
<s> and most people understand this , but they believe that one &apos;s set of input . </s>
<s> that our contribution to the system is choosing . </s>
<s> how often do we chose a political leaders -- and sometimes we use a lot of energy to choose new political leaders -- and then we &apos;re going to argue that the government to recognize our values and our needs , and then we expect that the government to recognize our values and bring our needs , and then hasn &apos;t changed ? </s>
<s> this is because the government is like a rising ocean , and politics is the top 15cm . </s>
<s> and what &apos;s in there is what we call bureaucracy . </s>
<s> and we use this word with such contempt . </s>
<s> but it &apos;s the contempt that we own , and for whom we &apos;re paying to be something that works against us , something else , and then we to humble [destroy the power of] ourselves . </s>
<s> people seem to think politics is sexy . </s>
<s> if we want that institution to work for us , we need to make bureaucracy sexy . </s>
<s> because that &apos;s where the actual regierungsarbeit is happening . </s>
<s> we need to go into the machinery of government . </s>
<s> so the occupythesec-bewegung actually did it . </s>
<s> did you see these guys ? </s>
<s> it &apos;s a group of people who wrote a very detailed 325-seitigen report , which is a response to the sec-memo of the gesetzesvorlage . </s>
<s> this is not politically active , it &apos;s bureaucratic . </s>
<s> now for those of us who have given the government , it &apos;s time we think about the world that we want to leave our children . </s>
<s> you &apos;ve got to think of the enormous challenges that you need to be . </s>
<s> do we really believe that what we need to do is to do what we need to do without improving an institution that can do all us ? </s>
<s> an government is absolutely necessary , but it needs to be more efficient . </s>
<s> the good news is that technology is able to make it possible , the function of the government is going to be able to be able to do something that can actually achieve the society . </s>
<s> and there &apos;s a generation that has been raised mitdem internet , and that means that it &apos;s not so hard to do things together , you have to build it just right . </s>
<s> now the average age of our fellows is 28 , so i am , unfortunately , almost a generation older than most of you . </s>
<s> this is a generation that grew up with her voice as granted . </s>
<s> they &apos;re not fighting this fight that we all fight , that &apos;s what we all need to talk about . </s>
<s> you can feel your mind , on every channel of time , and you do . </s>
<s> so , if you &apos;re faced with the problem of government , you don &apos;t worry about using your voices . </s>
<s> they use their hands . </s>
<s> they use their hands to write applications that improve the government &apos;s work . </s>
<s> and these apps allow us to use our hands to improve our communities . </s>
<s> this might be to jäten a hydranten , unkraut to jäten , umzudrehen a trash . </s>
<s> and sure , we could have gotten these hydranten that all the time , and a lot of people would do that . </s>
<s> but these algorithms are like small digital memories that we are not only consumers , and we &apos;re not just consumers of government that are willing to pay control and pay . </s>
<s> we &apos;re more than that , we are citizens . </s>
<s> and we &apos;re not going to improve government until we improve co2 . </s>
<s> so the question that i have for you all over here : if it comes to the big things that we need to do together all together , we &apos;re going to be a lot of voices , or are we going to be a lot of hands ? </s>
<s> thank you . </s>
<s> usually , my role of understanding people is about how wonderful the new technologies are going to be going to be going to be , and i thought , because i &apos;m here among friends , i would tell you what i &apos;m thinking about . and also trying to look back and understand what &apos;s really going on , with these incredible sprüngen after the forward , which quickly
<s> i &apos;m going to start by showing you a single boring slide . </s>
<s> you might want to put the slide on . </s>
<s> this is an slide that i chose from my folder . </s>
<s> it &apos;s not the details of the slide , but it &apos;s about the general shape . </s>
<s> this slide shows data of an analysis of the power of risc bias compared to the power of an local area networks . </s>
<s> the interesting thing here is that this slide , like so few others , which we often find in our field , is a kind of to be consensual curve . </s>
<s> in other words , every step here is one of the potency of leistungsskala . </s>
<s> and this is an novelty that we need to use this guy &apos;s scale of semi-logarithmischen curves in the field of technology . </s>
<s> something very strange is happening here . </s>
<s> this is basically what i &apos;m going to talk about . </s>
<s> so , if you could turn the light up again . </s>
<s> well , slightly clearer , because i &apos;m going to draw a little bit on the paper here . </s>
<s> now , why do we draw graphs in the technology on semi-logarithmischen curves ? </s>
<s> the reason for it is that if i draw it on a normal chart , where , say , this is the years , like , this is the years , the timeline of a species , and this is a random measure of technology that i want to do with a graph , which is silly . </s>
<s> they look like this . </s>
<s> and that doesn &apos;t tell us much . </s>
<s> now , if i want to record another technology , let &apos;s say a transporttechnologie , then it would bring out on the semi-logarithmischen scale , in the form of a flat line . </s>
<s> but if something like this is happening , this changes the qualitativen conditions . </s>
<s> so if the transporttechnologie was going to go quickly like the mikroprozessor-technologie progression , we could get overmorrow [obs.] into a taxi and put it in tokyo . </s>
<s> but it &apos;s not so fast . </s>
<s> this hasn &apos;t have been before in the history of technologie-entwicklung , that kind of rekursivem growth , which the order increases exponentially for a few years . </s>
<s> now , the question i &apos;m going to ask you is , if you look at these exponential curves , you see , they don &apos;t go on forever . </s>
<s> it &apos;s not possible that everything goes on forever and over forever as fast . </s>
<s> there are two options . </s>
<s> either it &apos;s going to get a classic s-kurve like this , until something completely new , or it &apos;s going to happen here . </s>
<s> that &apos;s about it . </s>
<s> well , i &apos;m an optimist , so i think of something like this in the way it &apos;s going to happen . </s>
<s> so this is really what it means , this is what we &apos;re right at right now . </s>
<s> we &apos;re at this line , in a transition from the bisherigen world to a new kind of world . </s>
<s> so the question i &apos;m going to ask , and i &apos;m also imagining myself , is , how do this new world be possible ? </s>
<s> what is this new state that takes the world ? </s>
<s> because the transition seems to be very , very baffling , if you &apos;re in the middle of it . </s>
<s> when i was a kid , that &apos;s where the future was somewhere in 2000 and the people often talked about what would happen in 2000 . </s>
<s> now here &apos;s a conference where people are talking about the future , and you realize the future is still the year 2000 . </s>
<s> that &apos;s what we don &apos;t . </s>
<s> so in other words , the future &apos;s future is declining every year since i &apos;m in this world . </s>
<s> and i think the reason for this is that we &apos;ll notice that anything is happening . </s>
<s> the transition happens . we can all feel it . </s>
<s> and we know that it &apos;s just not going to make any sense of taking 30 or 50 years to look at the future , because everything will be so different , that a very simple hochrechnung of what we &apos;re not doing now . </s>
<s> now , i want to talk about what this might be , this transition that we are in right now . </s>
<s> to make this happen first , i &apos;m going to talk about some other things that are really not dealing with technology or computers . </s>
<s> because i think in order to understand this really , we need to go back and look back and look at what &apos;s going on on a longer zeitskala . </s>
<s> and that &apos;s what i want to look at is the zeitskala of the earth . </s>
<s> i think the big one makes sense when you split it into some milliarden-schritte . </s>
<s> so let &apos;s go back , and it &apos;s an inch billion years , and the earth has been a huge , sterile work area steinklumpen with lots of chemicals . </s>
<s> now , if you think of the way that these chemicals were organized , then this is a pretty good picture of what it &apos;s like to do . </s>
<s> and i also think there are theories that start to understand how all of these things started with rna , but i &apos;m going to tell you a simplified representation story about what is , at this time , little öltröpfchen herumschwebten , which are different kinds of rezepten for chemicals . </s>
<s> some of these öltröpfchen gave up a special combination of chemicals that allowed them to integrate other chemicals from the outside , and so to grow . </s>
<s> they were all like this , started aufzuteilen . </s>
<s> these little öltröpfchen were the sinne zellenform . </s>
<s> however , these öltröpfchen were not about living in today &apos;s senses because every one of them was just a small , accidental occurrence recipe of chemicals . </s>
<s> and every time it divided , it allocated chemicals to ungleichen chemicals . </s>
<s> so each tröpfchen was slightly different . </s>
<s> in fact , the tröpfchen , which one for growth of optimalere composition had been growing up faster than others and integrated more chemicals from the outside , shared faster . </s>
<s> so , they tend to survive longer , and they are vermehrten levels . </s>
<s> so this is just a very simple chemical shape , but interestingly , when these tröpfchen learned a trick on abstraction . </s>
<s> one of the ways that we don &apos;t quite understand yet , we have the ability to learn information , niederzuschreiben information . </s>
<s> they &apos;ve learned to store the recipe of cell as information , and in a particular chemical shape that we call dna . </s>
<s> in other words , they have found a path that allowed you to find a path that allowed you to niederzuschreiben what it &apos;s made of that information and get copied . </s>
<s> and the amazing thing about this is that this kind of thing is to store information over the time of two billion years where it happened , right now . </s>
<s> in fact , it &apos;s the recipe for us , which is our genes , from the same code and the same notation . </s>
<s> and it uses every organism that uses exactly the same letters and the same code . </s>
<s> we &apos;re so far that we , only to the vergnügungszweck , can write anything in this code . </s>
<s> and i &apos;ve got 100 mikrogramm of a white pulvers , which i &apos;m trying to keep in airports from sicherheitspersonal . </s>
<s> it &apos;s in there -- what i &apos;ve been doing is i took this code -- the code is made up of normal letters that we use for to be a symbol of -- and i wrote my visitenkarte on a piece of dna , and i gave it 10 ^ 22 times . </s>
<s> so if someone wants to put a hundred million copies of my visitenkarte , i &apos;ve got enough for everybody in this room and even for everybody in this world , and it &apos;s right here . </s>
<s> if i had actually been a egoist , i would have written it on a virus and R-rated [Am.] it in the room . </s>
<s> so what &apos;s the next step ? </s>
<s> the dna principle of dna was an interesting step . </s>
<s> and the veranlagten these cells -- they made it happy for another billion years . </s>
<s> but then another one , really interesting step , where the things were completely different , and so these cells began to communicate and exchange information so that communities came from cells . </s>
<s> i don &apos;t know if you knew that , but bacteria can actually exchange their dna . </s>
<s> it &apos;s also why , for example , the reason why it &apos;s growing to antibiotics . </s>
<s> now some bacteria have figured out how to stay away from penicillin and have this information together in the dna with other bacteria in the dna , and now we have a lot of bacteria that are resistant to penicillin because they communicate with each other . </s>
<s> now , this association allowed the reasons of communities , which in some sense were in the same boat ; they were synergistic . </s>
<s> so they either survived either , or they kept running together , and that meant that when a community was successful , all of the individuals of the community were kept more away . </s>
<s> and the übergangsstelle is now there , where these communities zusammenrückten so close that they decided to write the recipe for the entire community into their dna . </s>
<s> and the next interesting phase , about another billion years . </s>
<s> at this point , we have mehrzellige communities , communities of many verschiedlichen zellentypen , which are acting together as individual organism . </s>
<s> in fact , we &apos;re also such a mehrzellige community . </s>
<s> we have a lot of cells that are not placed on their own . </s>
<s> your skin cells are useless without heart cells , muscle cells , brain cells and so on . </s>
<s> so these communities started weiterzuentwickeln so that the level of what evolution was going on is no longer the individual cell , but the whole zellengemeinschaft we call organism . </s>
<s> the next step happened now within this communities . </s>
<s> the zellengemeinschaften began to abstract information again . </s>
<s> and they developed special structures that were doing nothing else , as information . </s>
<s> and these are the neural structures . </s>
<s> so the neurons are the informationsverarbeitungsapparat that have been building these zellengemeinschaften . </s>
<s> they began to train specialists in the community , special structures that were responsible for learning , understanding and to complete what was said information . </s>
<s> and this was the brain and the nervous system of these communities . </s>
<s> this gave them an evolutionary benefit . </s>
<s> because at that point , an individual -- learning happened within the period of life of an organism , rather than through that evolutionary period . </s>
<s> so an organism , for example , could learn to eat a particular attraction because she liked bad and sick , the last time he ate it . </s>
<s> this could be done in the existence of a single organism for hundreds of thousands of years ago , because that information had to be learned by the individuals who died because of those blooms because they weren &apos;t there . </s>
<s> so the nervous nervous system has the evolutionsprozess with these particular informationsstrukturen , because evolution could now take on an individual . </s>
<s> it could take place within a time . </s>
<s> what happened next is that the individual organisms found a way to communicate with one another . </s>
<s> you know , as for example , the niftiest [sl.] gives us the known version of that kommunikationsart is human language . </s>
<s> it &apos;s an amazing invention if you think about it . </s>
<s> i &apos;ve got a very complicated , scruffs [Br.] and confused mass idea in my head . </s>
<s> and i &apos;m sitting here and i &apos;m basically giving grunzende sounds to me in the hope of creating a kind of confused mass idea in your head that a kind of resemblance with my original idea . </s>
<s> so we take something very complicated , so it shifts in sounds , a sequence of sound , and produce something very complicated in the heads of others . </s>
<s> so this allows us to go again as a unified organism . </s>
<s> and what we actually did , we , that humanity , is we started abstract . </s>
<s> we &apos;re going to go through the same levels that have gone through mehrzellerorganismen -- the abstraction of our methods , as we capture data . </s>
<s> the invention of the language for example was a little step in that direction . </s>
<s> telefonie , computers , videobänder , cd-roms and so on , all of our spezialisierten mechanisms that we &apos;ve built in our community to handle this information . </s>
<s> and it all connects together to something that &apos;s much bigger , and also able to evolve faster than we &apos;ve been . </s>
<s> so today , evolution can happen in the space of microseconds . </s>
<s> you &apos;ve seen tys little evolutionsbeispiel , where he showed a little bit of evolution in the convolution program , right in front of your eyes . </s>
<s> so now we have the zeitskalen zeitskalen again . </s>
<s> the first steps of history , which i told you , dauerten a billion years per piece . </s>
<s> the next steps , like the nervous system and the brain , dauerten several hundred million years . </s>
<s> then the in the near future steps , like language and so forth , less than a million years . </s>
<s> and the next steps , like electronics , seem to take few decades . </s>
<s> the process feeding itself by itself , and it &apos;s going to be like this , i think , auto-katalytisch is the word for it -- when something increases its änderungsgeschwindigkeit . </s>
<s> the more it changes , the faster it changes . </s>
<s> and i think that &apos;s what we &apos;re seeing here in this explosionsartigen curve . </s>
<s> we &apos;re seeing the process of feeding itself . </s>
<s> i live from building computers , and i know that i could use the mechanism that i use to build computers , not to use the mechanism that i &apos;ve been using . </s>
<s> my current activity is to design objects with such a high complexity , that it &apos;s impossible to design that in the traditional mind . </s>
<s> i don &apos;t know what any single transistor in the verbindungsmaschine does . </s>
<s> it &apos;s billions of them . </s>
<s> what i &apos;m doing instead , and what the designers of thinking is , is we think of a little bit of abstraktionsebene , committed this machine , and the machine does something that goes far beyond our capabilities , better and faster than we could ever do . </s>
<s> and they &apos;re doing it partly with methods that we don &apos;t even understand yet . </s>
<s> one method that is particularly interesting , and what i &apos;ve been using recently , is evolution itself . </s>
<s> we put a evolutionsprozess in the machine , which is what &apos;s happening in the building . </s>
<s> to give you an example , in the most extreme cases , we can make a program that are made out of random instructions . </s>
<s> we say , &quot; computers , generiere , please ask a hundred million random sequences of instructions . </s>
<s> now , please , please join all these randomly instructions , take all of the programs , and choose the people who are going to be vorgaben . &quot; </s>
<s> so in other words , i define what i want . </s>
<s> let &apos;s say i want to get in numbers , which would be a simple example that i &apos;ve been using for this . </s>
<s> so think of the programs that can overcome the most attractive numbers . </s>
<s> now , of course , if you have a chance to be very small instructions , the chance that you &apos;re going to get numbers in random instructions , so you won &apos;t be able to do that . </s>
<s> but one of those likes to be with something like a little bit of luck . </s>
<s> now i &apos;m saying , &quot; computers , take the 10 percent of the sequences that came from my vorgaben . </s>
<s> store these , lösche the rest . </s>
<s> now , all the übriggebliebenen that the numbers have placed in . </s>
<s> and that &apos;s an approach of rekombinierens , analog to reproduction . &quot; </s>
<s> take two programs and you create children through the exchange of your subroutinen , and the children to bequeath the properties of the subroutinen of the two programs . </s>
<s> so now i have a new generation of programs that were created by combinations of programs that are somewhat closer to these than others . </s>
<s> tell , &quot; please , this process . &quot; </s>
<s> put it back again . </s>
<s> there might be some mutations . </s>
<s> and try and do the whole thing with another generation . </s>
<s> all of these generations require very few milliseconds . </s>
<s> and so , i can go through a evolution of millions of years through the computer in a few minutes , or in more complicated cases . </s>
<s> finally , i get programs that can get numbers in perfect ways . </s>
<s> the fact is , these programs are so much more efficient than any program i could ever write by hand . </s>
<s> if i look at these books , i can &apos;t tell you how to work . </s>
<s> i tried to understand them . </s>
<s> it &apos;s intricate problem and curious programs . </s>
<s> but they do the job . </s>
<s> and i know and i &apos;m sure you do the job because you get out of a series of hunderttausenden programs that have done the job . </s>
<s> because their life depended on whether they did the job right . </s>
<s> once i sat in a 747 with marvin minsky , he ale a card and says , &quot; oh look . look at this . </s>
<s> there it says , &quot; this airplane consists of hunderttausenden kleinteilen , which are working together to make your flight more safe . &quot; do you not more confident this ? &quot; </s>
<s> we know that a entwicklungsprozess is not optimal when it becomes too complicated . </s>
<s> so we &apos;re starting to leave on computers for a process that is different different about classical engineering . </s>
<s> it allows us to produce things with much greater complexity than the normal methods would allow us to produce . </s>
<s> and yet , we don &apos;t quite understand the possibilities of it . </s>
<s> so gewissermassen gave us technology . </s>
<s> we &apos;re using these programs now to make computers much faster , so that we &apos;re able to do this processes even faster . </s>
<s> so it &apos;s getting a rückkopplung . </s>
<s> it &apos;s getting faster and faster and i think that &apos;s why it seems so baffling . </s>
<s> because all these new technologies from today are feeding themselves . </s>
<s> we &apos;re to heave . </s>
<s> we arrived at a point , which is the analog part at the time when einzeller-organismen evolved to mehrzeller-organismen . </s>
<s> so we &apos;re the amöben , and we can &apos;t quite freak out what the hell we are doing . </s>
<s> we &apos;re in the middle of that übergangpunkt . </s>
<s> but i really don &apos;t think anything else . </s>
<s> and i think it &apos;s very much to tell us that we are the end of evolution . </s>
<s> and i believe that all of us here are part of the creation of whatever it is next . </s>
<s> now , the lunch is before , and i think i &apos;m going to stop here before i &apos;m going to get rausgewählt . </s>
<s> my story starts right here in rajasthan , about two years ago . </s>
<s> i was underneath the sternenhimmel in the desert with sufi-sänger mukhtiar ali . </s>
<s> we talked about it that nothing has changed since the ancient indian epos mahabharata . &quot; </s>
<s> if we were going to go back to india , we went to a car and schwirrten across the sky . </s>
<s> now we do this with planes . </s>
<s> at the time , when the great indian kriegerprinz arjuna durst , he took a bow , fired out into the soil and water . </s>
<s> now we do this with bohrern and machines . </s>
<s> we came to the conclusion that magic and magic were replaced through machines . </s>
<s> it really made me sad . </s>
<s> i got some fear of technology . </s>
<s> it was scared that i could lose the capacity that i could enjoy sunset without camera and without tweet to my friends . </s>
<s> i found that technology should make magic possible and not kill . </s>
<s> when i was a little girl , my grandfather gave me his little silver wedding taschenuhr . </s>
<s> this piece 50 years old technology became the magischste thing for me . </s>
<s> she became a golden finish access to a world full of pirates and verunglückter ships and to sit at the feet of a master [also fig.] into my imagination . </s>
<s> it occurred to me as though our fancy clocks and cameras were dreaming from it . </s>
<s> they kept us to be inspired by this . </s>
<s> and so i went to the world of technology to see how i could use it to make magic more magic rather than kill . </s>
<s> with 16 , i started to illustrate books . </s>
<s> when i saw the ipad , i saw it as a piece of storytelling that readers could connect all over the world . </s>
<s> it can be the way we can think of it . </s>
<s> it can know where we are . </s>
<s> it takes images and text together , and animation , sounds and touch . </s>
<s> storytelling has always used more sense . </s>
<s> but what do we do ? </s>
<s> i &apos;m going to go to khoya , an interactive ipad app . </s>
<s> it says , &quot; put your finger on every single light . &quot; </s>
<s> and so -- this box says , &quot; this box belongs ... &quot; i write my name . </s>
<s> and that &apos;s where i get a character in the book . </s>
<s> and again , a letter for me falls down -- and the ipad knows through gps where i &apos;m living -- that &apos;s really addressiert to me . </s>
<s> the child in me is really excited about this possibility . </s>
<s> i talked a lot about magic . </s>
<s> i don &apos;t mean so zauberer and drachen , but the magic of childhood , the ideas we all had as children . </s>
<s> fireflies in a glass , i always thought was so exciting . </s>
<s> so you &apos;ve got to blow up the ipad and give out fireflies . </s>
<s> and the light path , through the rest of the book . </s>
<s> another idea that fascinated me as a child is that a whole galaxy can put up in a single murmel . </s>
<s> and so this is where each book and every world gets a little murmel that i put out of the magic device in the device . </s>
<s> and this opens up a map . </s>
<s> fantasybücher have always been cards , but these maps were static . </s>
<s> this map grows and leuchtet and serves to the rest of the book . </s>
<s> it also indicates the book of other places . </s>
<s> i go in here . </s>
<s> it &apos;s also important to me to create something that is Indian , but also very appropriate [up to date] . </s>
<s> this is the apsaras apsaras . </s>
<s> we &apos;ve heard all of feen and nymphen , but how many people outside india know their indian colleagues , the apsaras ? </s>
<s> the poor apsaras caught thousands of years in indras chambers for thousands of years . </s>
<s> and we bring them back in a contemporary history for children . </s>
<s> and a story that auseinandersetzt with new things , like the umweltkrise . </s>
<s> the theme of umweltkrise , a large problem for the last 10 years is that children are sitting in their rooms , on their computers , no turning out . </s>
<s> but now with mobile technology , we can take our children into the natural world with their technology . </s>
<s> in an interaction &apos;s book , you get sent to a search exercise , you &apos;ve got to go out and collect the ipads of the fictional images . </s>
<s> as a kid , i had collections of stöckern , rocks , to hail and muscheln . </s>
<s> and somehow , the children don &apos;t go anymore . </s>
<s> this is kindheitsritual . you &apos;ve got to go outside to do a chapter in a chapter and tag one photo . </s>
<s> in another chapter , you need a piece of baumrinde fotographieren and tag . </s>
<s> so you actually create a digital collection of photographs that you can put online . </s>
<s> a kid in london shows the picture of a fuchses and says , &quot; oh , i saw a fox . &quot; </s>
<s> a kid in india says , &quot; i saw a monkey . &quot; </s>
<s> it creates a kind of social network around a digital collection of photographs that you actually did . </s>
<s> there &apos;s a whole range of possibilities to connect the world and technology . </s>
<s> in the next book , we &apos;re planning a interaction where you &apos;re using the video video , and through augmented reality , a animation of elfen looks at the house in front of the house . </s>
<s> in one place , the screen builds with leaves . </s>
<s> you have to make the sound of winds , to be able to read it and read the rest of the book . </s>
<s> we all move to a world where the origins of technology are getting closer and able to get into magic and technology . </s>
<s> we use the energy &apos;s energy . </s>
<s> we bring our children and closer to the natural world and the magic , fun and love of our childhood through the simple medium of a story . </s>
<s> thank you . </s>
<s> this is really extraordinary honor for me . </s>
<s> i spend most of my time with people in untersuchungshaft , prisons or todeszellen . </s>
<s> i spend most of my time with the social schwächsten in the sozialbausiedlungen and in places where there &apos;s very much hopelessness . </s>
<s> to be here at ted , to see and hear , how stimulated this is , i &apos;ve got a lot of power . </s>
<s> in the short run , here &apos;s one thing , ted has an identity . </s>
<s> you can say things that have influence around the world . </s>
<s> and sometimes when something comes up , it gets a meaning and strength that wouldn &apos;t have otherwise . </s>
<s> i say that because i believe that identity is very important . </s>
<s> we saw some amazing presentations . </s>
<s> and i think that we &apos;ve learned that we &apos;ve learned that the words of a teacher make meaning , but the words of a dedicated teacher are particularly meaningful . </s>
<s> as a doctor , you can do good . as a more thoughtful , you can do more . </s>
<s> and so i want to talk about the power of identity . </s>
<s> i didn &apos;t learn that in my work , by the way . </s>
<s> i learned that from my grandmother . </s>
<s> i was convicted in a family , a traditional afroamerikanischen household was dominated by a matriarchin , and that matriarchin was my grandmother . </s>
<s> she was a taffe , powerful woman , she did . </s>
<s> she had the last word in every familienstreit . </s>
<s> she was also the starting point of many differences in our family . </s>
<s> she was the daughter of to stand up to scrutiny sklavenfamilie . </s>
<s> their parents were born in 1840ern in virginia as a slave . </s>
<s> she was born around the alps , and the experience of slavery was very strong . </s>
<s> my grandmother was strong , but she was also affectionate . </s>
<s> when i met her as a kid , she came up to me and umarmte me . </s>
<s> she made me realize that i couldn &apos;t breathe breathe . then she let me go . </s>
<s> one or two hours later , when i met her , she came up to me and said , &quot; bryan , you &apos;re feeling more of my hug ? &quot; </s>
<s> and if i say no , i said , &quot; no , &quot; i said , &quot; yes , &quot; let me go alone . </s>
<s> she was something that made that you wanted to be in their direction . </s>
<s> the only problem with this was she had 10 children . </s>
<s> my mom was the youngest of her 10 children . </s>
<s> sometimes when i wanted to spend time with her , it was hard to get her attention . </s>
<s> my cousins ran around everywhere . </s>
<s> i remember , i &apos;ve been having eight or nine , i remember i woke up in the morning and went in the living room . all my cousins ran around . </s>
<s> my grandmother was sitting on the end of the zimmers , staring at me . </s>
<s> first , i thought that was a game . </s>
<s> i looked at her and she smiled , but she looked very severe . </s>
<s> this went like 15 or 20 minutes . then she stood up to me , she took me at her hand and he said , &quot; come on , bryan . you and i need to talk . &quot; </s>
<s> i remember it as if it was yesterday . </s>
<s> i never forget it . </s>
<s> she took me out , and she said , &quot; bryan , i &apos;m going to tell you something , but you have to promise that you don &apos;t want it . &quot; </s>
<s> i said , &quot; promised , grandma . &quot; </s>
<s> she said , &quot; ehrenwort ? &quot; i said , &quot; yes . &quot; </s>
<s> she sat me and looked at me . she said , &quot; i want you to know that i &apos;ve seen you . &quot; </s>
<s> she said , &quot; i think you &apos;re something special . &quot; </s>
<s> she said , &quot; i think you can do anything you want . &quot; </s>
<s> i will never forget that . </s>
<s> then she said , &quot; you have to promise me only three things , bryan . &quot; </s>
<s> i said , &quot; okay , grandma . &quot; </s>
<s> she said , &quot; well , for the first time , you &apos;ll always love your mom . &quot; </s>
<s> she said , &quot; your mom is my baby , and you need to promise that you &apos;re going to be taking care of you . &quot; </s>

<s> i &apos;m not saying that because i think it &apos;s chaste . i say that &apos;s what identity means . </s>
<s> if we create the right kind of identity , we can tell people all around us that they don &apos;t believe in first . </s>
<s> we can get them to do things that they thought they couldn &apos;t do . </s>
<s> of course , my grandmother would say all of her grandchildren , they &apos;re special . </s>

<s> our system is not only going to be linked by questions that have to do with rassenzugehörigkeit , it &apos;s also defaced by poverty . </s>
<s> we &apos;ve got a justizsystem in this country where they &apos;re treated much better when they &apos;re rich and guilty to be poor and innocent . </s>
<s> money , not to encumber with debts , impacts the result . </s>
<s> nevertheless , we seem to be satisfied with this . </s>
<s> a politics of fear and anger have convinced us that these problems aren &apos;t our problems . </s>
<s> we &apos;ve lost contact . </s>
<s> i think that &apos;s interesting . </s>

<s> the only country in the world . </s>
<s> i found people in todeszellen . </s>
<s> the question of death is an interesting question . </s>
<s> we think because it has taught us that the real question is , did a human being a person to be dying for one of them begangenes crimes ? </s>
<s> this is a very sensitive question . </s>
<s> but you can also think differently about how we see our identity . </s>
<s> the other view is not to make anyone engaged for a crime , but did we make it to kill ? </s>
<s> i think that &apos;s fascinating . </s>
<s> the death penalty rate defined by error . </s>
<s> in nine people that we &apos;ve been executed , one that we &apos;ve been executed , is one that we &apos;ve been executed for . </s>

<s> but somehow we can abzunabeln ourselves from this problem . </s>
<s> it &apos;s not our problem . </s>
<s> it &apos;s not our burden . </s>
<s> it &apos;s not our fight . </s>
<s> i talk a lot about those questions . </s>
<s> i talk about race and the question of if we got it right . </s>

<s> and these older people come to me now and say , &quot; mr , stevenson , they &apos;re talking , they &apos;re talking to talks . they say to them that you should stop telling us that we have to stop our nation in our nation with terrorism , after 9 / 11 . </s>
<s> they say , &quot; no -- tell the people we grew up with it . &quot; </s>
<s> and after that terrorism , of course , came out of the rassentrennung and decades of the to be a racist and apartheid motivierten . </s>
<s> and yet , in our country , we have a dynamic -- we don &apos;t like to talk about our problems . </s>
<s> we don &apos;t like to talk about our history . </s>
<s> and that &apos;s why we don &apos;t really understand what our actions are doing in the historical context . </s>
<s> we always run together . </s>
<s> we always create new tensions and conflicts . </s>
<s> it &apos;s hard to talk about race , and i think that &apos;s because we &apos;re not willing to approach the truth of truth and reconciliation . </s>
<s> in south africa , people understood that the rassentrennung couldn &apos;t evolve without the willingness of truth and reconciliation . </s>
<s> even after the genocide in rwanda , this willingness , but not in this country . </s>
<s> i kept some talks in germany about death . </s>
<s> it was fascinating , because one of the scientists stood up after my talk , and he said , &quot; you know , it &apos;s deeply bizarre to hear you hear . &quot; </s>
<s> he said , &quot; there &apos;s no death in germany . </s>
<s> and of course , it can &apos;t give it any more . </s>
<s> it was very quiet . then a woman said , &quot; with us , it &apos;s impossible that we ever to declare ourselves again for the systematic killing of people . </s>
<s> it would be conscience-free of us , aware and aimed . &quot; </s>
<s> i thought about it . </s>
<s> as it would be to be able to live in a world where the german state would make people to arrange , especially when they were a lot of jews . </s>
<s> it would be beyond all bearing  [postpos.] . </s>
<s> it would be conscience-free . </s>
<s> and yet , in this country , in the united states of the old südens , we &apos;re getting people back -- here &apos;s the risk for death than if it &apos;s black . </s>
<s> and yet , there &apos;s mental abkopplung . </s>
<s> i think our identity is threatened . </s>
<s> if we don &apos;t deal with it , with these difficult topics , the positive and wonderful things are also affected . </s>
<s> we love innovation . </s>
<s> we love technology and creativity . </s>
<s> we love entertainment . </s>
<s> but ultimately , these realities are overshadowed by suffering , abuse , herabsetzung , ausgrenzung . </s>
<s> it seems to me to combine both of them . </s>
<s> because what we &apos;re talking about is that we need more hope , more engagement , more dedication to create in a complex world . </s>
<s> for me , it means to produce time and think and talk about the poor , the benachteiligten who are never going to be at ted . </s>
<s> but thinking in ways that are integrated in our own lives . </s>
<s> we all need to believe things that we can &apos;t see . </s>
<s> we do this . we &apos;re so rational we are so rational . </s>
<s> innovation , creativity , and development , not just come from our minds . </s>
<s> they come from ideas that are driven by believing in our hearts . </s>
<s> it &apos;s this kopf-herz-verbindung that i believe that it helps us not only be open to all the bright and begeisternden things , but also the dark and problematischen . </s>
<s> vaclav havel , the great Czech authorities politician </s>
<s> &quot; when we were fighting the oppression in eastern europe , we tried to do everything . but what we needed most was hope , an intellectual orientierung , the willingness to be able to be in hoffnungslosen places and witness . &quot; </s>

<s> there &apos;s no volume about technology and design that allows us to be entirely human and even human , until we don &apos;t have eyes and ears for poverty , ausgrenzung and injustice . </s>
<s> i want to warn you . this kind of identity is very much more of us than if we don &apos;t do any of us . </s>
<s> she &apos;s going to touch her profoundly . </s>

<s> we want to eradicate masseninhaftierungen . </s>
<s> i thought my usual talk , and then she looked at me and said , &quot; mhmm . mhmm . mhmm . &quot; </s>
<s> she said , &quot; this is going to be very , very tired . &quot; </s>
<s> then ms. carr came to me , put a finger on my face , and he said , &quot; and that &apos;s why you have to be very , very to hang in (there) [coll.] . &quot; </s>
<s> and that &apos;s why i think the ted braver should be braver . </s>
<s> we need to think of ways to ask these challenges : this problem , that &apos;s suffering . </s>
<s> because ultimately our humanity depends on our humanity . </s>
<s> in my work , i learned very simple things . </s>
<s> and i learned some very simple things . </s>
<s> that we are all more than the worst we &apos;ve ever done . </s>
<s> i think that &apos;s true for each person on the planet . </s>
<s> if somebody &apos;s lying , it &apos;s not just a liar . </s>
<s> if someone is taking something that doesn &apos;t listen to him , it &apos;s not just germs . </s>
<s> even people &apos;s killing it &apos;s not just murderer . </s>
<s> and because that is , there &apos;s a basic human being to respect the law . </s>
<s> i also believe that in many parts of this country , and with security in many parts of the world , the opposite of poverty is not wealth . </s>
<s> i don &apos;t believe that . </s>
<s> i believe in many places is the opposite of poverty . </s>
<s> and finally , i think that even though it &apos;s so dramatic to do so beautiful and inspiring , and so inspiring , we can &apos;t be measured at the end of our technology , not the things that we &apos;re developing to our intellect and minds . </s>
<s> finally , a society is not measured by measuring its rich and powerful and privileged , but on how they deal with the poor , the verurteilten , the inhaftierten . </s>
<s> because in this context , we begin to understand the truly amazing amazing things that make us up . </s>
<s> sometimes i get the balance . one story . </s>
<s> sometimes i dränge too much . </s>
<s> i &apos;m getting tired , like all of us . </s>
<s> sometimes the ideas of thinking about our thinking , in a very important way . </s>
<s> i vertrete these kids who were sentenced to very hard to chastise . </s>
<s> i go to the untersuchungsgefängnis and visit a client who likes to be 13 or 14 years old , which is to be the adult one . </s>
<s> and then i wonder , how could this happen ? </s>
<s> how can a judge make somebody turn into something that it &apos;s not ? </s>
<s> the judge looks at it as adults , but i see a kid . </s>
<s> one night , i stayed on long and thought , oh my god , when a judge can transform us into something else , then he has to have zauberkräfte . </s>
<s> right , bryan , the judge has zauberkräfte . </s>
<s> you should also wish . </s>
<s> and because it was late , and i couldn &apos;t really think of any more , i began to work on one . </s>
<s> i had a 14jährigen , poor black young young boys . </s>

<s> so , in my thesis , i explained that nuclear staatsanwaltschaft and the police and verfahrensfehler be specific . </s>
<s> there was a crazy line on that in this country , that there &apos;s nothing that is more sophisticated , that there &apos;s only some failures . </s>
<s> the next morning i woke up and knew no more if i was just dreamed of this crazy , or actually wrote it . </s>
<s> and i didn &apos;t just write it to my horror , but also sent to the court . </s>
<s> a couple of months went on , and i just forgot everything . </s>
<s> but finally , i decided , my god , i got to go in on trial and this crazy case . </s>
<s> i got into the car , and was really overwhelmed . </s>
<s> so i went to the court . </s>
<s> and i thought , this is going to be so difficult , so painful . </s>
<s> finally , i got out of my car , and i went up the stairs . </s>
<s> when i was the staircase to the court , there was an elderly , black man , who was in the court . </s>
<s> when he saw me he came over and said , &quot; who are you ? &quot; </s>
<s> i said , &quot; i &apos;m a lawyer . &quot; he said , &quot; you &apos;re a lawyer ? &quot; i said , &quot; yes . &quot; </s>

<s> then he flüsterte . </s>
<s> he said , &quot; i &apos;m so proud of them . &quot; </s>
<s> and i have to say it gave me power . </s>
<s> there &apos;s something very profound about me , identity , the capacity of each individual , contribute to a community , to a community perspective of hope . </s>
<s> well , i was visiting the gerichtssaal . </s>
<s> when the leader saw me . </s>
<s> he said , &quot; mr. stevenson , did you give that verrückten ? &quot; </s>
<s> i said , &quot; yeah . &quot; and then we started to discuss . </s>
<s> more people would come in , just because they were mad . </s>
<s> i was writing these crazy things . </s>
<s> polizeibeamte came in and assistant secretary of state [female] [Am.] staatsanwälte and büroangestellte . </s>

<s> i saw my job go on and go down . </s>
<s> he kept seeing over the window and hear all the tohuwabohu . </s>
<s> he went up and out . </s>
<s> after all , this older black man came along with a very , very senior gesichtsausruck , and he sat right behind me , almost on the verteidigungsbank . </s>
<s> ten minutes later , the judge announced a break . </s>

<s> the older black man stood up , and he saw the deputy guy , and he saw me , and he said , &quot; i &apos;m here to say this young man , don &apos;t lose the goal of the eyes . don &apos;t give up . &quot; </s>
<s> i &apos;ve come to ted because i think many of you have understood that the moral pendulum of the universe is far off , but that it zuneigt . </s>
<s> that we are not fully evolved as human beings , until we don &apos;t care about human rights and grundwerte . </s>
<s> that our daily survival is linked to every single one . </s>
<s> that we need to connect our visions of technology and design , of entertainment and creativity with humanity , compassion and justice . </s>
<s> and most of all , i want to think of those of you who are looking at this , just say , don &apos;t get the goal out of your eyes . don &apos;t give up . </s>
<s> you have in this audience , this community has seen an obvious wish and belongs to help you and do something . </s>
<s> what else can we do ? </s>
<s> bryan stevenson : well , there are ways . </s>
<s> if you &apos;re living in california , there &apos;s a volksentscheid in this spring where it &apos;s about a effort that is about to be able to create a effort , some of the geldstrom umzuleiten that are in the politics of punishment . </s>
<s> here , in california , for example , in the next five years , you &apos;re going to spend a billion dollars for death rates . </s>
<s> and yet , 46 percent of all tötungsdelikte don &apos;t have a verhaftung . </s>
<s> 56 percent of the vergewaltigungsfälle are not on trial . </s>
<s> there &apos;s the opportunity to do something . </s>
<s> this referendum is suggesting to invest the money into more sicherheitskräfte and security . </s>
<s> i think there are ways . </s>
<s> over the last three decades , verbrechensrate has been tremendous down . </s>
<s> this is the fact that is often given in a context with elevated inhaftierungszahlen . </s>
<s> what would you tell somebody who believes that ? </s>
<s> well , actually , the number of gewaltverbrechen actually has not changed . </s>
<s> most of the masseninhaftierungen , in this country , was not really in the classroom of gewaltverbrechen . </s>
<s> it was the fehlgeleitete kreuzzug against drugs . </s>
<s> so the vast high numbers are getting at the 1960s . </s>
<s> we &apos;ve let ourselves go from the rhetoric of punishment . </s>
<s> now we &apos;ve got » -gesetze that get people from the bars for a fahrraddiebstahl , for a fahrraddiebstahl , for the theft geringfügigen good , rather than that you force the things that give them victims . </s>
<s> i think we need to do more to help people who have become victims of a straftat , not less . </s>
<s> and i believe that our current bestrafungsphilosophie never help us . </s>
<s> i think that &apos;s what we need to change . </s>
<s> bryan , you &apos;ve got a string string here . </s>

<s> so these are just some of the clips that i collected over the last six months -- but it could be the last six days , or the last six years . </s>
<s> the fact is that the media would prefer it to show us negative topics , because our minds have been paying attention to these topics . </s>
<s> and there &apos;s also a very good reason for it . </s>
<s> every second every second , our senses begin much more information than we can ever process . </s>
<s> and because we &apos;re not going to be more important than our survival , the first stop station for all of the information is a part of our temporallappens , the amygdala . </s>
<s> so the amygdala is our frühwarnsystem , our gefahrendetektor . </s>
<s> it assorted (asst'd.) and ploughed through  [pervaded] the whole information to the search of the gefahr of our environment . </s>
<s> so if we think of the news , we prefer to look for false news . </s>
<s> and the old adage , &quot; if it blutet , the demand , &quot; is very true . </s>
<s> now , with all of our digital devices that seven days a week , every seven hours a day on all of these negative news , it &apos;s no wonder that we are pessimistic . </s>
<s> it &apos;s no wonder everybody thinks that the world is getting worse . </s>
<s> but maybe that &apos;s not the case . </s>
<s> maybe that &apos;s the reality . </s>
<s> maybe the tremendous progress that we &apos;ve done in the last century , it &apos;s made by a series of forces , so that it will be possible for us in the next three decades , to create a world of scarcity . </s>
<s> now , i &apos;m not saying we don &apos;t have big problems -- climate crisis , artensterben , water , water and energieprobleme -- that we have . </s>
<s> and as humans , we are much better at probleme problems in very long terms , but they eventually end up changing . </s>
<s> let &apos;s see what we &apos;ve been able to do in the last century so that we can predict the development . </s>
<s> over the last hundred years , the average life expectancy has been doubled more than doubled , which is increased threefold by inflation . </s>
<s> child mortality has dropped by a tenth . </s>
<s> that &apos;s where the ernährungs- , the elektrizitäts- transport- and the costs , they have a declining . </s>
<s> steve pinker has shown us that we are now in a very peaceful era of life . </s>
<s> and the charles kenny , according to charles kenny , up from 25 percent to 80 percent . </s>
<s> we live in really extraordinary time . </s>
<s> and a lot of people forget this . </s>
<s> and we keep increasing our expectations constantly . </s>
<s> we actually redefined poverty . </s>
<s> think that a great percentage of americans who are living in the poverty , access to electricity , water , toilets , kühlschränken , mobile phones , mobile phones , mobile phones , mobile phone and cars . </s>
<s> the richest rhinoviruses of the last century , the imperatoren of the earth , would never have been able to dream that luxusgüter . </s>
<s> the basis of a lot of things make technologies , and these are growing expotentiell . </s>
<s> so , my good friend of ray kurzweil has shown us that every tool that &apos;s going to be global technologies on the line of moore &apos;s law is about the response of moore &apos;s law and doubled the preis-performance-quotient for 12 to 24 months . </s>
<s> that &apos;s why the mobile phone costs about a million times less and is faster faster than a supercomputer in the &apos; 70s . </s>
<s> now look at this curve . </s>
<s> this is moore &apos;s law for the last hundred years . </s>
<s> notice two things about this curve . </s>
<s> first of all , how smooth it is -- in good , like in bad times , war or peace , recession , depression and hochkonjunktur . </s>
<s> this is the result of efficient computers that build faster computers . </s>
<s> it slowed out to none of our big problems . </s>
<s> also , despite their logarithmic verlaufs on the left , it &apos;s upwards . </s>
<s> so the growth rate itself is speeding up . </s>
<s> and on this graph , on the back of moore &apos;s law , we find a series of extraordinary technologies that are available . </s>
<s> &quot; cloud-computing , &quot; which is something that my friends at autodesk call &quot; infinite-computing , sensors and networks , 3d-drucker , 3d-drucker that allow us to democratize the personal production on our planet , synthetic biology , fuel , vaccine vaccine and food , digital medicine , nano-materialien and artificial intelligence . </s>

<s> that was significant . </s>

<s> so four years ago , in ray kurzweil , and i &apos;m here at ted a new university called singularity university . </s>
<s> we bring our students to all these technologies with special focus on how these can be used to solve the great challenges of humanity . </s>
<s> and each year , we &apos;re asking the students , companies , products and services , which within a decade , make the life of billions of people . </s>
<s> think about it that a group of students can actually influence the lives of billions of people . </s>
<s> thirty years ago , that would have been ridiculous . </s>
<s> today , we can to relegate (to) the dozens of companies that have done this . </s>
<s> if i think of it possible , i mean i don &apos;t mean a life of luxury for everybody on this planet ; it &apos;s about creating a life of opportunities . </s>
<s> it &apos;s about creating goods of goods . </s>
<s> scarcity is contextual , and technology is a very expensive force . </s>
<s> here &apos;s an example . </s>
<s> this is the story of napoleon iii. in the 19th century . </s>
<s> he &apos;s the guy on the left . </s>
<s> he has invited the king of siam to dinner . </s>
<s> napoleons soldiers got silber-besteck , napoleon homegrown vegetable . </s>
<s> the king of siam , however , got aluminium-besteck . </s>
<s> aluminum was the most valuable metal on the planet , more valuable than gold and platin . </s>
<s> this is why the dome was made of aluminum . </s>
<s> even though aluminum 8,3 prozent percent is not coming on as pure metal . </s>
<s> it &apos;s connected by oxygen and silikate . </s>
<s> but then the technology of elektrolyse was developed and made aluminiumherstellung so cheap that we use it with our wegwerf-mentalität . </s>
<s> and then let &apos;s put that analogy into the future . </s>

<s> what do you believe for a kardiologen or a nurse or a orthopäden , an geburtshelfer , should be a rettungsassistenten ? </s>
<s> 1000 , very good . </s>
<s> the truth is that nobody in the entire field knows what a good surgeon or doctor should be . </s>
<s> what we &apos;re doing though , is that every single of them , i grew up , included in the world to be perfect . </s>
<s> never make a mistake , but no one does the details of what &apos;s going to be done . </s>
<s> and that &apos;s the message i took in medical school . </s>
<s> i was an adobe obsessiver student . </s>
<s> in high school , a coach was told that brian goldmann would learn for a bluttest . </s>
<s> and that &apos;s what it was . </s>
<s> and i learned in my little dachstube , in upper-class circles general hospital , not far (from) from here . </s>
<s> and i learned everything . </s>

<s> i even knew the differentialdiagnose about (renal) clearance tuberous breast azidose . </s>
<s> and it &apos;s time that i collected , and more knowledge . </s>
<s> and i was good , i joined with taken with a grain of salt [Am.] [Aus.] [fig.] laude . </s>
<s> and i left the medical school school that i was looking at , if i knew everything and knew everything , or at least as much as possible as possible as possible as possible as possible that i was really immune to that . </s>
<s> and it worked for for a while when i met my wife . </s>
<s> i residierte at a lehrkrankenhaus here in toronto as i was taken into the hospital &apos;s hospital . </s>
<s> at this point , i was served the kardiologischen layer in the kardiologischen service . </s>
<s> and it was my quest , as the notfallpersonal kardiologischen &apos;s advice to study the notfallpatienten . </s>
<s> and to give feedback to my oberarzt . </s>
<s> i studied ms. printers and she was in atemnot . </s>
<s> and when i watched her , she made wheezy voice sounds . </s>
<s> and when i abhörte her chest with the stethoskope , i could hear a knackendes sound on either sides that told me that they were suffering from kongestiver heart failure . </s>
<s> this is a state where the heart fails , instead of pumping the entire blood on it , put a part of the blood in the lung and slowly set up the blood . </s>
<s> and that was not a very difficult diagnosis . </s>
<s> i asked her and made me to the treatment . </s>
<s> i gave her aspirin . i gave her medicine to take the pressure from the heart . </s>
<s> i gave her medicine that we call diuretics , water tabletten , so she ausschied the fluid . </s>
<s> and over a period to two hours , they began to feel better . </s>
<s> i felt really good . </s>
<s> and i made my first mistake ; i sent them home . </s>
<s> actually , i did two mistakes . </s>
<s> i sent them back home without talking to my oberarzt . </s>
<s> i didn &apos;t take the control up and did what i was supposed to be , what a call was going to be at the oberarzt , to let him abzuklären so that he would have had a chance to do a kind of picture . </s>
<s> and he knew that he would have been able to do extra information on her beizusteuern . </s>
<s> maybe i did a good reason . </s>
<s> maybe i didn &apos;t want to be the person in need of care doctor . </s>
<s> maybe i thought that maybe it was so successful and so able to make his responsibility that i was so much , and so i would be able to worry to my patients without knowing it . </s>
<s> my second mistake was worse . </s>
<s> so this is what i sent them home , i ugly duckling a little voice in me that tried to say to me , &quot; duh , not a good idea . don &apos;t do that . &quot; </s>
<s> in fact , it was very much that i asked the nurse that i asked the nurse , which was to be used by women , &quot; do you believe it &apos;s okay when you go home ? &quot; </s>
<s> and the nurse thought about it , and he said , &quot; sure , i think it &apos;s going to be okay . &quot; </s>
<s> i remember that it had been yesterday . </s>
<s> so i signed copy the entlassungspapiere and an ambulance and rettungsassistenten , and they took it home . </s>
<s> and i came back to work . </s>
<s> the rest day , i had this nagende feeling in my stomach . </s>
<s> but i kept working on it . </s>
<s> and at the end of the day , i grabbed my things , and then the hospital and went to the room to go home with the car of the car , when i did something that i didn &apos;t . </s>
<s> i went home through my notfallabteilung . </s>
<s> and there was another nurse , not the sister who &apos;d seen after ms. printers , but another three words to me , and those three words fear most of the notfallärzte that i know . </s>
<s> other medical medical people are afraid of it , but the notfallmedizin is particularly special , because we &apos;re only seeing the patients . </s>
<s> three words &apos; : remember what ? </s>
<s> &quot; remember the patients waiting home ? &quot; </s>
<s> asked the nurse businesslike . </s>
<s> &quot; so she &apos;s back , &quot; she said in this particular case . </s>
<s> so she was back . </s>
<s> she was back and dying . </s>
<s> for about an hour after she ended up home after i &apos;d sent her home , she collapsed her , and her family phoned 911 . the rettungsassistenten sent them back to the notfallstation with a blood pressure . </s>
<s> they were barely atmete and was blue initiated . </s>
<s> the notfallpersonal broke all the strands . </s>
<s> they gave her blutdruckerhöher . </s>
<s> they schlossen them to the beatmungsmaschine . </s>
<s> i was shocked and to the inner disordered . </s>
<s> and i go through this rollercoaster because she came out of the stabilisation , and hoping that she was going to recover . </s>
<s> and after two , three days , she realized that she would never to awake again . </s>
<s> she didn &apos;t have any behandelbaren gehirnschaden . </s>

<s> and this was the first time i learned this myself . </s>

<s> this is the kind of lehrreicher shame . </s>
<s> the unhealthy kinds of things that i &apos;m talking about is the one in the innersten . </s>

<s> and it wasn &apos;t a reason for me , he was very dear . </s>
<s> he spoke with his family and i &apos;m sure that he would not be sued to the to billow and make sure i was not indicted . </s>
<s> but i asked myself to these questions . </s>
<s> why didn &apos;t i ask the oberarzt ? why did i send her up ? </s>
<s> and then in my worst moments , how could i make a dumb mistake ? </s>
<s> why did i go to medicine ? </s>
<s> slowly , slowly , it legte . </s>
<s> i started feeling better . </s>
<s> and then on a day of day , there was a hole in the clouds and the sun , and i thought maybe i can feel better again . </s>
<s> and i was thinking to myself that if i raised my efforts to perfection and never beging a mistake that the voice could to silence . </s>
<s> and she did . </s>
<s> and i worked on it . </s>
<s> and then it happened again . </s>
<s> two years later , i had service service in a kommunalen hospital north of toronto , and i begutachtete an 25 man with gereiztem rachen . </s>
<s> it was a lot , and i in a hurry . </s>
<s> he always showed up . </s>
<s> i looked into the rachen , and it was a little bit of pink . </s>
<s> and i gave him a prescription for penicillin and sent him forward . </s>
<s> and even when he went out of the door , he showed up his rachen . </s>
<s> two days later , i came to my next notfalldienst , and my chefärztin asked me to go to a conversation in her office . </s>
<s> and she said the three words : do you remember ? </s>
<s> &quot; do you remind the patient gereizten ? &quot; </s>
<s> it turned out to be a streptokokken-infektion . </s>
<s> he had an potentially death trap [coll.] [also: deathtrap] disease called epiglottitis . </s>
<s> you can see this , but it &apos;s not an infection of rachens , but it &apos;s the top atemwege , and it causes the verschluss of the atemwege . </s>
<s> and luckily , he didn &apos;t die . </s>
<s> he got intravenous antibiotics antibotica and recovered a few days later . </s>
<s> and i went back through the same tortur of shame and self-doubt , felt me , and i went back to work to work again and again and again . </s>
<s> in a notfallschicht , i missed two blinddarmentzündung . </s>
<s> there &apos;s been a lot of things going on , especially when you think that you &apos;re working in a hospital that &apos;s only having 14 patients a night . </s>
<s> in both cases , i didn &apos;t send them home in both cases , and i didn &apos;t have any mängel . </s>
<s> one thing i thought about it was nierensteine . </s>
<s> and i ordnete the pulse of the kidney , so , when that was without (so much as) lifting a finger , my colleague at the wiedervorstellung of the patient was a verhärtung verhärtung in the lower sector , called the operateure . </s>
<s> the other one had very strong diarrhea . </s>
<s> i ordnete fluid intelligence to to rehydrate and asked my colleagues as well . </s>
<s> and that &apos;s what he did , and he saw a verhärtung in the right lower sector , called the operateure . </s>
<s> they got operierte in either cases , and they were doing well . </s>
<s> both cases nagten me , fraßen me up . </s>
<s> and i would be happy to tell you that my worst mistake happened only in the first five years , which i call many of my colleagues , but total nonsense . </s>
<s> some of my klöpse happened in the last five years . </s>
<s> alone , abashed and without (so much as) lifting a finger . </s>
<s> here &apos;s the problem : if i don &apos;t end up with my mistakes and talk about them , if i &apos;m able to talk about the little voice that says , what really happened to me , how can i share it with my colleagues ? </s>
<s> how can i teach you my mistakes so that they don &apos;t get the same ? </s>
<s> if i had to go into a room -- like now , i have no idea what you &apos;re thinking about me . </s>
<s> when did you hear the last time of fehlschlag 'bout  [coll.] [about] about fehlschlag ? </s>
<s> oh yeah , you go to a cocktail party , and there you might hear about any other doctor , but you won &apos;t hear somebody talk about your mistakes . </s>
<s> if i took into a room full of colleagues and asked them to tell you what i told you about , i would not be able to get the end of the second story , before it was really going to get you to , you know , you would be really uncomfortable with somebody who would be a joke , you would switch to the topic and forget the
<s> and in fact , if i could know my colleagues , that a orthopäde in my hospital could have lost the wrong leg , they trust me to look at it in the eyes . </s>
<s> this is the system we live in . </s>
<s> it &apos;s a totally denial of mistakes . </s>
<s> it &apos;s a system where there &apos;s two basic positions -- those that make mistakes and the ones that do not make money . those who are einschränkt schlafmangel and the Seven Wonders of the (Ancient) World without the einschränkung who results with bad results and with good results . </s>
<s> it &apos;s almost an essential response like antibodies that attack people . </s>
<s> and there &apos;s the idea that if we get those who ban mistakes from the medicine that an independent system stays . </s>
<s> but there are two problems with this . </s>
<s> for about 20 years of medical science and journalism , i &apos;ve been using a personal medical trial for medical fehler and phantom withdrawal [from cash dispenser] treatments so that all of me use my first article for one of my first papers , i was going to go to the toronto for my white coat , black art , wrote to learn . </s>
<s> and what i learned is that errors are absolutely absolutely essential . </s>
<s> we are working in a system in which every day , in which one in 10 medikationen is either a false or wrong dosed , in the krankenhausinfektionen , always become more and more meaningful and cause devastation or birth . </s>
<s> in this state , about 24,000 canadians die of umgänglichen errors . </s>
<s> in the united states , for example , the institute of medicine is equivalent to 100,000 . </s>
<s> they &apos;re very strong untertreibungen , because we don &apos;t look at the problem that we should . </s>
<s> and this is the crux of food . </s>
<s> in an krankenhaussystem in which health care , you can &apos;t keep up with it . </s>
<s> schlafmangel is ubiquitous . </s>
<s> we can &apos;t get rid of it . </s>
<s> we have an independent mistake so that we can take a perfect krankheitsverlauf for a patient with no pain . </s>
<s> then i take the same patient with brustschmerz , make it soaked with sweat [postpos.] and babblative [archaic] and gebe a slightly easy breath , and suddenly , the story is infiltrated with contempt . </s>
<s> i don &apos;t take the same path . </s>
<s> i &apos;m not a robot ; i don &apos;t always do things . </s>
<s> and my patients are not cars ; they don &apos;t always tell me their symptoms . </s>
<s> all of this is inevitable inevitable . </s>
<s> so if you take the system like this , how i &apos;ve been taught it , and all the fehlerbehafteten gesundheitsexperten edited out , neither more left . </s>
<s> and you know the leier about people who want to talk about their worst cases ? </s>
<s> in my show , black coat style , i &apos;ve got the habit to say , &quot; this is my worst mistake , &quot; i was going to say to anyone from rettungsassistenten to the chefarzt of the kardiologen , &quot; this is my worst mistake &quot; blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , &quot; what about yours ? &quot; and then i
<s> and then they expand their songs , they came up in front of their head , then look down and vulnerable , and start telling their stories . </s>
<s> they want to tell their stories . they want to share their stories . </s>
<s> they want to be able to say , &quot; look , don &apos;t make the same mistakes i &apos;m going to go . &quot; </s>
<s> what you need is an environment that staggered you . </s>
<s> what you need is a new medical culture . </s>
<s> and it starts with a doctor . </s>
<s> it &apos;s a man &apos;s new arzt doctor , white to his humanity , accepted them , is not proud of making mistakes , but all of this stuff comes from them to learn something that can be passed on . </s>
<s> they share their experience with others . </s>
<s> they &apos;re aided (by) when others talk about their mistakes . </s>
<s> and they show other mistakes to their mistakes , not by bloßzustellen , but in a commitment , unterstützenden , so that all of them benefit . </s>
<s> and she &apos;s working in a medical culture that recognizes that people fill the system with life , and if that &apos;s what it &apos;s like , people also make mistakes at time . </s>
<s> so the system that &apos;s going to evolve is what makes it easier to find mistakes that can &apos;t predict people &apos;s health care , and it &apos;s also able to respond to what anybody who are looking at public health , and it can also respond to what anybody who are seeing of their potential , and they can actually respond to , and that specifically for people like

<s> i &apos;m the new predetermined breaking point . </s>
<s> i am a person . i do mistakes . </s>
<s> but i &apos;m bedaure das. , but i &apos;m trying to learn best of the best to learn from it to bring it in . </s>
<s> i don &apos;t know what they &apos;re doing , but i can live with it . </s>
<s> let me close with three of my own words : i remember . </s>
<s> i &apos;m going to talk about a tiny , small idea . </s>
<s> it &apos;s about veränderbare normwerte . </s>
<s> and because you can explain this idea in a minute , i &apos;m going to tell you about three stories to use time . </s>
<s> the first story is written by charles darwin , one of my heroes . </s>
<s> you know , he was 1835 . </s>
<s> you might think he &apos;s killing finken , but that &apos;s not true . </s>
<s> he actually collected fish . </s>
<s> and he described it as a very common thing . </s>
<s> it was a zackenbarsch . </s>
<s> up to the 1980s , it was fish in large style . </s>
<s> it &apos;s now on the red list known . </s>
<s> we &apos;ve heard this story many times from the galapagos or from other places , it &apos;s not very special . </s>
<s> yet , we still get on the galapagos . </s>
<s> we still think they &apos;re initially . </s>
<s> the broschüren describe them still as being intact . </s>
<s> what happened here ? </s>
<s> the second story is to give up another concept , the veränderbare taillenweite , to clarify . </s>
<s> because i experienced it when i studied a lagoon in west-afrika . </s>
<s> i went there because i grew up in europe , and i wanted to go into africa later . </s>
<s> i thought i could integrate myself . </s>
<s> and i got a bad sonnenbrand , and i was convinced that i really wasn &apos;t out of there . </s>
<s> it was my first sonnenbrand . </s>
<s> as you can see , it was the lagoon of palmen and a few mangroven . </s>
<s> there were buntbarsche of about 20 inches , schwarzkinnmaulbrüter , to be a code for sth. [coll.] [euphemism] as a formality . </s>
<s> the fischgründe of these buntbarsche were very fertile , and the fishermen were living well and making decisions in ghana . </s>
<s> when i returned 27 years later , the fish ran down half its size . </s>
<s> stores are five centimeters . </s>
<s> they were genetically crushed . </s>
<s> it &apos;s still fish . </s>
<s> people still were happy . </s>
<s> and the fish also has been lucky to be still there . </s>
<s> so it completely changed , and yet everything has changed . </s>
<s> my third little story is telling my mittäterschaft at the introduction of schleppnetzfischerei . </s>
<s> in the &apos; 70s , rather at the beginning of the 60s -- förderte europe . </s>
<s> fischförderung meant countries that were starting 100 hundred fish , the industrial fischfang that &apos;s called mutiara 4 . </s>
<s> and i went on to it , and we machten out across the southern ocean ocean and particularly in the javasee . </s>
<s> we didn &apos;t have words for what we started there . </s>
<s> i know now that it was the cause of the ocean . </s>
<s> ninety percent of our fangs were sponges , other animals that are connected to that . </s>
<s> the largest part of the fish , the little dots there on the rubble , the trümmerhaufen , was korallenriff-fische . </s>
<s> essentially , the cause of the ocean was on the deck , and then became echoed . </s>
<s> these images are extraordinary because it goes very fast . </s>
<s> within a year , you end up with a survey , and then starts with the commercial fishing . </s>
<s> the reason is changed . so , in this case -- a hard reason or soft coral is pulpier &apos;s crap . </s>
<s> this is a dead turtle . </s>
<s> they were not eaten , they threw them away because they were dead . </s>
<s> once we started a living time . </s>
<s> she was not been drowned . </s>
<s> then they wanted to kill her , because you could eat them well . </s>
<s> in fact , this mountain to be announced <TBA> every single time it &apos;s been put on each other , if you go to areas , if you go to them , it &apos;s never been fished . </s>
<s> it &apos;s not documented . </s>
<s> we change the world , but we don &apos;t remember it . </s>
<s> we adapt our normwerte of the new levels , and call us not in mind what was there . </s>
<s> if you generalised  [Br.] it , this is what happens . </s>
<s> on the y-axis , there are some good things : biodiversity , number of the orca , the green of their country , the wasservorrat . </s>
<s> over time it changed . it changes , because for the people , their actions are obvious . </s>
<s> every generation looks at the images that are using them at the beginning of their conscious life , as standard and to be announced <TBA> it . </s>
<s> the difference will then be seen as loss . </s>
<s> but they don &apos;t get those verluste losses . </s>
<s> it can give a sense of changes . </s>
<s> and at the end , they want to just get rid of the erbärmlichen remains . </s>
<s> this is exactly what our goal is . </s>
<s> we want to get things that are gone , or things that are not as they are . </s>
<s> you could now think that the problem of people who were sure that when they were living in räuberischen societies , they killed animals and they were aware of a few generations of what they had done . </s>
<s> because clearly , an animal that has often been done very often , before it ausstirbt . </s>
<s> so you don &apos;t lose a lot of theoretical animals . </s>
<s> you &apos;re always losing rare animals . </s>
<s> and that &apos;s why , not as big loss . </s>
<s> over time , we focus on the large animals and in the ocean , the big fish . </s>
<s> they &apos;re getting fewer because we catch them . </s>
<s> over time , little fish left , and we think that &apos;s the normwert . </s>
<s> the question is , why do people accept this ? </s>
<s> well , because they don &apos;t know it was different . </s>
<s> of course , many people , scientist , confirm that it was really different . </s>
<s> you &apos;ll confirm it , because the evidence of what you do in an ancient shape is not as you would like to describe the evidence . </s>
<s> for example , there &apos;s an anecdote that the report of a kapitäns that was looking at a lot of fischvorkommen that are not implemented in this area , can &apos;t be used by fischereiwissenschaftlern , or by fischereiwissenschaftlern . </s>
<s> so we have the situation that people don &apos;t know the past , even though we live in educated societies , because they &apos;re not trusting the sources of the past . </s>
<s> this shows the great great role that can play a marine reserve . </s>
<s> because by the field time , we basically set up the past . </s>
<s> we make the past again , that people can &apos;t understand , because the normwerte changed and very low . </s>
<s> so the people who are looking at a marine reserve and benefit from the graph that allows it to to back off [vehicle] their normwerte . </s>
<s> what about the people who are not able to do because they don &apos;t have access -- the people in the dark west . </s>
<s> here , i think the art and the film might be able to fill the gap and simulation . </s>
<s> this is the simulation of chesapeake bay . </s>
<s> and a long time ago , there were grauwale -- 500 years ago . </s>
<s> and the farbtöne and -schattierungen think they might remind from &quot; avatar . &quot; </s>
<s> if you think of &quot; avatar , &quot; if you think about why people were so touched by it -- besides the pocahontas-geschichte , why was it so touched by bilderwelt ? </s>
<s> because it wachruft something that has been lost in some sense . </s>
<s> so my need , the only one i &apos;m going to give goes to cameron , so he turns out to cameron , so he &apos;s dreht in the water . </s>
<s> thank you . </s>
<s> in the &apos; 80s , you had to ostdeutschland , if you had a typewriter , you had to take a typewriter . </s>
<s> they also had to take a leaf with beispieltext from that typewriter . </s>
<s> the reason for it : the government could figure out where a text came from . </s>
<s> they found an article with falschem gedankengut , and they could to chase down [track down] the creator of that sentiment . </s>
<s> and in the west , in the west , we couldn &apos;t understand how anybody could do something like this , and how much that would do it ? </s>
<s> in our own countries , we would never do that . </s>
<s> but in 2011 today , you can buy a new farblaserdrucker from the leading laserdruckerfabrikanten and have a page , then this page is bright bone flecke on each page , in a pattern that lets the page clear on you and your printer . </s>
<s> this is happening today . </s>
<s> and that seems to be aufzuregen . </s>
<s> and that was an example that our governments are using the technology against us , the citizens . </s>
<s> and this is one of the three hauptquellen of existing online-problemen . </s>
<s> let &apos;s see what &apos;s going on in the world : we can split attacks into categories . </s>
<s> we have three hauptgruppen . </s>
<s> there are online-kriminelle . </s>
<s> for example , this is mr. dimitry golubow from kiew in ukraine . </s>
<s> and the motives of online-kriminellen are very easy to understand . </s>
<s> these people make money . </s>
<s> they use online-angriffe to make lots of money , a huge bunch of money . </s>
<s> so there &apos;s several well-known cases of online-millionären , multimillionären that made your money through attacks . </s>
<s> this is wladimir tsastsin from tartu in estonia . </s>
<s> this is alfred gonzalez . </s>
<s> stephen watts . </s>
<s> björn sundin . </s>
<s> this is matthew anderson , tariq al-daour and so on and so forth . </s>
<s> these people have gone online to wealth , but they &apos;ve been illegal to use for example , for example , to raise money from our bankkonten , as we do our online-banking , as we do our online-banking , or also keylogger that our kredikarteninformationen do in the input on the keyboard , as we buy over a infected computer online . </s>
<s> the u.s. intelligence company , two months ago , took the swiss account from mr. sam jain up here , and that account were 14,9 million dollars when it was frozen . </s>
<s> mr. jain himself is in free foot , the aufenthaltsort is unknown . </s>
<s> and what i &apos;m saying is that it &apos;s more likely to us that we become victims of an online-verbrechens , as a consumer in the real world . </s>
<s> and it &apos;s very obvious that this is only going to get worse . </s>
<s> in the future , most crimes are going to play online . </s>
<s> the second angreifergruppe that we can observe today are not motivated by cash . </s>
<s> they &apos;re motivated by something else -- a duck , or an opinion , or through their audience . </s>
<s> groups like anonymous are , over the last 12 months , and they become one of the hauptspieler on the online-angriffe . </s>
<s> so these are the three hauptangriffsgruppen : criminals that are doing it for money , hacktivisten like anonymous anonymous , who are doing with it , but the last group is nations , governments that lead attacks . </s>
<s> that &apos;s where we are , like as a formality . </s>
<s> it shows great what happens when governments attack their own citizens . </s>
<s> diginotar is a vollmachtszertifikat from the netherlands -- it was it . </s>
<s> last fall , it had to sign it , because diginotar had been hacked . </s>
<s> somebody was honored , and had this system seriously . </s>
<s> and last week in a meeting with dutch regierungsvertretern , i asked one of the senior question , if he was able to do it for possible people died because of the diginotar-hacks people . </s>
<s> and his answer was &quot; yes . &quot; </s>
<s> now , how do people die of a hacks like this ? </s>
<s> diginotar is a zertifizierungsstelle . </s>
<s> they sell zertifikate . </s>
<s> what do you do with zertifikaten ? </s>
<s> well , you need a board board if you got a website with https , with ssl-verschlüsselten services , for example . </s>
<s> now we all use each of us , or a lot of us , or a lot of us , like iran , where dissidenten foreign markets are able to use where iran are , where they know that they can trust more trust than local anbietern , and that they &apos;re coded by ssl-verbindungen , so the local government can &apos;t to nose around in their talks . </s>
<s> but if you look at a foreign foreign . </s>
<s> zertifizierungsbehörde to chip and counterfeit bond to demonstrate . </s>
<s> and this is what happens in the case of diginotar . </s>
<s> how does it compare to the arab spring and the things that happened in egypt ? </s>
<s> well , in egypt , the bribes in april , 2011 , the headquarters of the egyptian geheimpolizei , they found a lot of records . </s>
<s> this path was called &quot; finfisher . &quot; </s>
<s> and in this folder , notes were sold in a local community that the egyptian government had sold a few programs that they could -- in very large frame -- had any communication of egyptian citizens . </s>
<s> they sold this program for 280.000 euro on the egyptian government . </s>
<s> the firmenhauptquartier is right here . </s>
<s> so western governments provide totalitarian dictatorship governments with hilfsmitteln so that they can do their own citizens . </s>
<s> but western governments also help us . </s>
<s> for example , in germany , just a few weeks ago called &quot; staatstrojaner , &quot; which was a trojaner , as a formality regierungsvertretern , who was used by german regierungsvertretern to to stool [esp. Am.] [sl.] their own citizens . </s>
<s> if you &apos;re going to be suspected in a kriminalfall , then with almost security , your phone becomes tapped . </s>
<s> but we &apos;re still beyond that . </s>
<s> they tap along their communication web . </s>
<s> they use tools like the staatstrojaner to bespielen their computers with a trojaner that allows them to monitor their entire communication , to accumulate their online-diskussionen abzuhören to collect their passwörter . </s>
<s> so if we &apos;re thinking about things like this , the obvious answer to the people would be , &quot; ok , that sounds bad , but it doesn &apos;t matter to me because i am a dear little boy citizen . </s>
<s> i don &apos;t have to worry . </s>
<s> i have nothing to hide . &quot; </s>
<s> and this argument makes no sense . </s>
<s> privacy needs to be . </s>
<s> privacy is not arguing . </s>
<s> it &apos;s not a decision between privacy and security . </s>
<s> it &apos;s a decision between freedom and control . </s>
<s> and as we are today , in 2011 , our governments like trust , but every is right we get to go through . </s>
<s> and do we trust that we &apos;re blind for any future government , an government we might have in 50 years ? </s>
<s> these are the questions that we need to deal with the next 50 years . </s>
<s> it may seem strange , but i &apos;m a big fan of betonblocksteinen . </s>
<s> the first betonblocksteine were made 1868 and entstammten to a simple idea : module module from cement with mutual measurements that fit . </s>
<s> betonbausteine became very rapidly the meistgenutzte baueinheit in the world . </s>
<s> they put us in able to build things that were bigger than us , buildings , bridges , a brick after another . </s>
<s> basically , the betonbaustein was the betonbaustein of our time . </s>
<s> for almost a hundred years later , in 1947 , lego came out . </s>
<s> it was called the &quot; automatically verbindende stone . &quot; </s>
<s> and within a few years , lego moved in every household . </s>
<s> it &apos;s estimated that over 400 billion stones were produced -- or 75 stones for each person on this planet . </s>
<s> they don &apos;t have to be an engineer to create beautiful houses , beautiful bridges or beautiful buildings . </s>
<s> lego made it for all possible . </s>
<s> lego basically has the betonbaustein , the building block of the world , took us into a building block for our imagination . </s>
<s> meanwhile , in the same year , the bell labs , the next revolution announced the next revolution . </s>
<s> the transistor was a small plastikeinheit that would allow us from a world of static , aufeinandergestapelten building blocks to a world where all the interactive was made . </s>
<s> like the betonblock , the transistor allows us to build much larger , more complex blocks , one stone . </s>
<s> but there &apos;s a hauptunterschied : the transistor was only for experts . </s>
<s> and i personally think that that &apos;s not the baustein of our time for experts , and therefore i decided to change this . </s>
<s> eight years ago , i was at the media lab , and i began to explore this idea of how to put the engineers in the hands of artists and designer . </s>
<s> a couple of years ago , i began to design littlebits . </s>
<s> let me show you how they work . </s>
<s> littlebits are electronic habitats that have a specific function . </s>
<s> they &apos;re canned  [fig.] , light , clay , engine and sensor . </s>
<s> and the best thing about it is that they connect with magnets together . </s>
<s> you can &apos;t put it wrong around . </s>
<s> the stones are color-coded [Am.] . </s>
<s> green is ausgabe , blue is power , pink is input and orange wires . </s>
<s> so all of the things you need to do is to connect up a blue and green one , and you can build much bigger kreislaufe . </s>
<s> they add a blue to a green , and you can do light . </s>
<s> you can put a switch in between , and you have a little dimmer . </s>
<s> take the switch out around a pulsmodul , which is here , einzufügen , and you did a little blinker . </s>
<s> put that buzzer for an extra effect , and you &apos;ve made a lärmmaschine . </s>
<s> i &apos;m going to stop this . </s>
<s> in terms of the simple play , littlebits is actually quite powerful . </s>
<s> instead of coding , if you need to program or to wire or to braze , they allow you to littlebits with simple , intuitive gestures . </s>
<s> so , to go speed the same nucleus or slow it down , just rotate this button , and it makes the impulse faster or slower . </s>
<s> the idea behind littlebits is that it &apos;s a growing library . </s>
<s> we want to bring every single interaction in the world into a gebrauchsfertigen stone . </s>
<s> lights , sounds , solarelemente , motors -- everything should be available . </s>
<s> we &apos;ve gone around with children and see them playing with it . </s>
<s> and it was an incredible experience . </s>
<s> the most beautiful thing is , how do you start the electronics that you &apos;re doing in everyday cities , and that they don &apos;t learn at school . </s>
<s> like for example , like a nachtlicht , or why the doors of the aufzugs offenbleiben , or (rather) what remained of it , reacted like an ipod . </s>
<s> we &apos;ve also brought littlebits to designschulen . </s>
<s> so , for example , we had no experience of any kind of experience in electronic things that began to play as materials . </s>
<s> this is what we see with filz , paper and water bottles , like geordie ... </s>
<s> a few weeks ago , we brought littlebits to risd and gave them some designers that had no technical experience -- only box , wood and paper -- and told them , &quot; power . &quot; </s>
<s> here &apos;s an example of a project that they made , a bewegungsgesteuerte konfetti-kanone . </s>
<s> but wait , this is really my lieblings-projekt . </s>
<s> it &apos;s a hummer from play-doh , the fear of play-doh . </s>
<s> for these nicht-ingenieure , littlebits came up with another material , electronics became another kind of material . </s>
<s> and we want to do this material for all available . </s>
<s> so , littlebits is open source . </s>
<s> you can go to the website , download all the designvorlagen and make them yourself . </s>
<s> we want to encourage the world &apos;s creators , the inventor , the inventors , the mitwirkenden , of the world that we live in , this interactive world . </s>
<s> so , pull them and start to invent them . </s>
<s> thank you . </s>
